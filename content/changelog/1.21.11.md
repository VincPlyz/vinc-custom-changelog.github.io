  * Damage is based on Spear material, the player’s view angle, and the velocity of both the player and the target
  * While holding down the button, the attack goes through three stages before returning to idle:
    * Engaged: The Spear can deal damage, knockback, and dismount mounted enemies if the speed is above the required thresholds
    * Tired: Indicated by the Spear rotating to a vertical position and shaking. The Spear can deal damage and knockback (but not dismount) if the speed is above the required thresholds
    * Disengaged: Indicated by the Spear being lowered, pointing downwards. The Spear gives damage but not knockback or dismount if the speed is above the required threshold
  * The Spear's range when used by mobs is half of that when used by players, but they can deal damage, dismount and knockback at lower speeds than the players

## Texture Filtering

  * New option in Video Settings
  * Controls the method used to sample textures when they are viewed at an angle or from a distance
  * Available values are "None", "RGSS", and "Anisotropic"
  * The default depends on your graphics preset and hardware
  * "RGSS" (Rotated Grid Super Sampling) is a shader-based filtering method that improves texture clarity at a moderate performance cost
    * This is available on all hardware
  * "Anisotropic" is a hardware-based filtering method that provides the best texture clarity
    * The maximum anisotropy may be "2x", "4x", and "8x", controllable by a separate slider
    * If your hardware does not support it, Anisotropic Filtering will do nothing
    * This significantly impacts video memory usage (especially combined with a high mipmap count)

  * The input modfier to change GUI scale in the Video Settings screen
  * Stopping the recipe book from cycling through variations of items

## Performance Improvements

## Debug Renderer Changes

  * Same as before, do not treat debug renderers as supported features, they are there only to aid with development
  * More debug renderers are now available through the Debug Settings screen
  * Some existing renderers were improved
  * The performance of debug renderers has been significantly improved

## Graphics Presets

  * Settings on the Video Settings screen have been reordered and split into 3 sections: "Display", "Quality & Performance", and "Preferences"
  * The following settings that were duplicating accessibility settings have been removed from the Video Settings screen:
    * "View Bobbing"
    * "Glint Speed"
    * "Glint Strength"
    * "FOV Effects"
    * "Distortion Effects"
  * Tweaks that were previously hidden behind the "Graphics" setting have been split out to be configurable independently:
    * "See-Through Leaves"
    * "Show Vignette"
    * "Weather Effect Radius" configures the distance in blocks within which rain and snow are visible
    * "Improved Transparency" resolves some of the transparent geometry rendering issues at a significant GPU cost, previously was hidden behind "Fabulous!"
  * A new "Preset" slider was added to the top of the "Quality & Performance" section
    * Presets, as you would expect based on gaming industry standard, control most of the "Quality & Performance" settings at once, not only the ones that were previously hidden behind the "Graphics" setting
    * Available presets are "Fast", "Fancy", "Fabulous!" and "Custom"
    * The default preset is "Fancy" for new players
    * But for players who are upgrading to this version the preset will be set to "Custom" to preserve your current configuration

## UI

  * Menu sliders will now "stick" to the closest available value when you release them after dragging with a mouse
  * When using keyboard to change slider values, arrow keys will now move the slider to the next available value, not by one pixel as before
  * The `inF3` button in the Debug Option screen has been renamed to `inOverlay`

  * The language selection screen now has a search box to filter languages
  * Renamed the "Show Music Toast" option to "Music Toast"
    * Added a third state to the "Music Toast" option, allowing it to only be shown in the pause menu

# Technical Changes

  * The Data Pack version is now 94.1
  * The Resource Pack version is now 75.0
  * The Minecraft Server Management Protocol version is now 2.0.0
  * Added ClientFps JFR event
  * Experience packets that do not change the player's experience progress or level are no longer sent by the server
  * Added support for KQueue on OSX to improve network connection performance

## Network Protocol

## Minecraft Server Management Protocol Version 2.0.0

  * Added a new notification `server/activity`
    * Indicates that a network connection to the server has been initiated
    * Rate limited to 1 notification per 30 seconds
  * Enable authentication from web browsers
    * Authenticate by passing the token in `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header when opening the WebSocket connection
      * Example: `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: minecraft-v1, <token>`
    * Requests authenticating this way are subject to Origin header checks. This requires configuration of allowed origins on the server side using `management-server-allowed-origins`. The default value is empty, meaning `Sec-Websocket-Protocol` authentication is effectively disabled
  * In the `typed_game_rule` and `untyped_game_rule` schemas, the type of the `value` field has been changed from string to take either a boolean or an integer
    * Also, it now uses the game rule resource location as the key

# Data Pack Versions 89.0 through 94.1

  * Added `stopwatch` command for keeping track of real time
  * Certain visual and gameplay effects can now be controlled by Environment Attributes
  * World Border interpolation is now dependent on game ticks instead of real time
    * This means the World Border will no longer move when the game is paused
    * It will also respect any changes made by the `/tick` command
  * Changed loot function `filtered` to allow running modification when predicate fails
  * Added `discard` loot function
  * Added new Coral Zombie Nautilus mob variant
    * The Zombie Nautilus variants can be data-driven
  * Item textures were split out of the `blocks` atlas into a separate new `items` atlas
    * It means that the commands that were referencing the `blocks` atlas for item textures now need to reference the `items` atlas instead

## Zombie Nautilus Variants

  * Zombie Nautilus variants can be data-driven by adding entries to `data/<namespace>/zombie_nautilus_variant/<id>.json`
  * This feature is experimental
  * Fields in file:
    * `model` \- one of: `normal`, `warm`
    * `asset_id` \- namespaced id for this variant asset, resolves to `assets/<namespace>/textures/<path>.png`
    * `spawn_conditions` \- a uniform variant selection rule explained below

### Spawn conditions

#### `minecraft:biome`

  * Checks if entity is spawning in specific biomes
  * Fields:
    * `biomes` \- single entry, list or a tag describing biomes

#### `minecraft:moon_brightness`

  * Checks if current moon brightness is within certain range
  * Fields:
    * `range` \- floating point range (a single number or an object like `{"min": 1, "max": 2}`)

#### `minecraft:structures`

  * Checks if entity is spawning in specific structures
  * Fields:
    * `structures` \- single entry, list or a tag describing structures

## Commands

  * Resource suggestions now show results in any namespace instead of just within `minecraft`

### Added `stopwatch`

  * New command that allows the creation of a Stopwatch that keeps track of real time
  * Stopwatches do not depend on game ticks
  * They only run when the server/world is running, even when paused

Syntax:

  * `stopwatch create <id>` \- creates a Stopwatch with the given namespaced ID
  * `stopwatch query <id> [<scale>]` \- shows the elapsed time of the given Stopwatch in seconds and returns it scaled by the given value and truncated.
    * Default scale: `1`
  * `stopwatch restart <id>` \- restarts the given Stopwatch
  * `stopwatch remove <id>` \- removes the given Stopwatch

> **Developer's Note** : _This command is added to replace the need of using
> world borders to keep track of real time. The intent is to change the world
> border to be dependent on game ticks in a future snapshot. If you've relied
> on this way of measuring the passage of real time before, please switch to
> using the new command and let us know if anything doesn't work as intended.
> Thank you!_

### Changes to `execute`

  * Added new syntax `/execute if|unless stopwatch <id> <range>`
  * Allows to compare the elapsed time of a given Stopwatch with a floating point value range
    * The Stopwatch value is measured in seconds and has an accuracy of at most a millisecond
    * Example: `/execute if stopwatch foo:bar ..10 run say Stopwatch foo:bar has not reached 10 seconds yet`

### Changes to `worldborder`

  * The `time` arguments now specify ticks by default, but can also specify seconds or in-game days using an `s` or `d` suffix

## Game Rules

Game rules have been moved into a registry. With that, all game rules have
been renamed from their previous camel case names to resource locations in
snake case.

Additionally, the following game rules have been further renamed:

  * `announceAdvancements` -> `minecraft:show_advancement_messages`
  * `commandBlocksEnabled` -> `minecraft:command_blocks_work`
  * `command_modification_block_limit` -> `minecraft:max_block_modifications`
  * `disableElytraMovementCheck` -> `minecraft:elytra_movement_check`
    * The value is inverted accordingly in places that use the resource location
  * `disablePlayerMovementCheck` -> `minecraft:player_movement_check`
    * The value is inverted accordingly in places that use the resource location
  * `disableRaids` -> `minecraft:raids`
    * The value is inverted accordingly in places that use the resource location
  * `doDaylightCycle` -> `minecraft:advance_time`
  * `doEntityDrops` -> `minecraft:entity_drops`
  * `doImmediateRespawn` -> `minecraft:immediate_respawn`
  * `doInsomnia` -> `minecraft:spawn_phantoms`
  * `doLimitedCrafting` -> `minecraft:limited_crafting`
  * `doMobLoot` -> `minecraft:mob_drops`

  * `maxCommandChainLength` -> `minecraft:max_command_sequence_length`
  * `maxCommandForkCount` -> `minecraft:max_command_forks`
  * `naturalRegeneration` -> `minecraft:natural_health_regeneration`
  * `snowAccumulationHeight` -> `minecraft:max_snow_accumulation_height`
  * `spawnRadius` -> `minecraft:respawn_radius`
  * `spawnerBlocksEnabled` -> `minecraft:spawner_blocks_work`

### Limits

Some game rules that previously did not have a limited value range now do:

  * `minecraft:max_block_modifications`: Minimum `1`
  * `minecraft:max_command_forks`: Minimum `1`
  * `minecraft:max_command_sequence_length`: Minimum `0`
  * `minecraft:max_entity_cramming`: Minimum `0`
  * `minecraft:max_snow_accumulation_height`: Minimum `0`, maximum: `8`

  * `minecraft:players_sleeping_percentage`: Minimum `0`
  * `minecraft:random_tick_speed`: Minimum `0`
  * `minecraft:respawn_radius`: Minimum `0`

### Added `minecraft:fire_spread_radius_around_player`

  * Controls the maximum distance in blocks that fire can spread around a player
    * This replaces the previous `doFireTick` and `allowFireTicksAwayFromPlayer` game rules, which have now been removed
    * Setting it to `0` will disable fire spreading
    * Setting it to `-1` will allow fire spreading without players around
    * Limit: Minimum `-1`

## Game Tests

In the `game_rules` test environment the keys `bool_rule` and `int_rule` have
been replaced with a single key `rules`. It is a map from game rules resource
locations to the game rules value. The value type is either integer or boolean
depending on the game rule.

## Attributes

## Timelines

Timelines are a new concept defined in data packs under the `timeline`
registry (i.e. found under `data/<namespace>/timeline/<id>.json`).

Timelines specify game behavior based on the absolute day time (that which is
set by `/time set`). Timelines optionally can specify a period over which they
will be repeated.

Primarily, Timelines are able to modify game behavior or visuals by applying
Environment Attribute modifiers.

Format: object with fields

  * `period_ticks`: optional integer, defines the duration in ticks over which the timeline will repeat
    * If not specified, the timeline will not repeat
  * `tracks`: optional map between Environment Attribute IDs and a corresponding Environment Attribute Track object
    * See the section on Environment Attributes below for details

Timelines by default have no effect unless they are included by a dimension -
see the Dimension Types section below.

## Environment Attributes

Environment Attributes provide a data-driven way to control a variety of
visual and gameplay systems.

Each Environment Attribute controls a specific visual or gameplay effect: for
example, `minecraft:visual/sky_color` controls the color of the sky, and
`minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates` controls whether water can be placed at
a given location.

> **Developer’s Note:** _This system and many of the introduced attributes
> should be considered very experimental, and may still change significantly
> in coming snapshots and releases. In the meantime, we would as always love
> to hear any feedback or suggestions you may have!_

### Sources

Environment Attribute values can be provided by the following Environment
Attribute sources (in order of low to high priority):

  * Dimensions
  * Biomes
  * Timelines
  * Weather (not data-driven)

While Biomes act as a source to modify an attribute by position, Timelines can
modify an attribute based on time.

The "effective" value of the Environment Attribute (i.e. what will actually
show up in game) will be some combination of the values provided by each
source according to their priority.

For example, in the following scenario:

  * The `overworld` dimension provides `sky_color = #00ff00` (green)
  * The `plains` biome provides `sky_color = #ff0000` (red)

When the player is in the `plains` biome, they will see the red `sky_color`,
while anywhere else in the `overworld` they will see green.

When an Environment Attribute source provides an Environment Attribute, it
can:

  * Override the value, such as the `plains` biome overriding the `overworld`'s `sky_color` in the above scenario
  * Apply a modifier to a previous value (see section on Modifiers below)

![Pale garden biome that has blue fog, and bubble particles that has been
modified with a data
pack.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/1.21.11environmentattributes.jpg)

### Modifiers

As described in the above example, an Environment Attribute source may simply
override the value of a particular attribute. However, it is sometimes also
desirable to rather apply a modifier to a value provided by a source with
lower priority.

For example, in the following scenario:

  * The `overworld` dimension provides `water_fog_end_distance = 96.0`
  * The `plains` biome modifies `water_fog_end_distance` with a `multiply` modifier of `0.85`

When in the `plains` biome, the `water_fog_end_distance` will be resolved to
`96.0*0.85 = 81.6`, while in any other Overworld biome, it will resolve to
`96.0`.

The kinds of modifiers available depends on the type of Environment Attribute.
The most basic modifier, supported by every Environment Attribute, is the
`override` modifier. This behaves purely as an override of the preceding
value. If not specified by an Environment Attribute source, the modifier will
always be assumed to be `override`.

Full descriptions of the available modifiers and their behaviors can be found
in the Common Modifiers section below.

### Interpolation

While modifiers describe how a value provided by one source is applied on the
value from a preceding source, interpolation describes the combination of
values within a source. Only some Environment Attributes support
interpolation. This allows for the smooth transition between two or more
values, such as when moving between two biomes.

Between multiple Biomes, interpolation is performed on values from a source
after modifiers have been applied. Within a Timeline, interpolation is
performed on the modifier arguments before they get applied.

#### Biomes

For example, in the following scenario:

  * The `plains` biome provides `sky_color = #ff0000` (red)
  * The `desert` biome provides `sky_color = #ffff00` (yellow)

`sky_color` is one such attribute that will transition smoothly based on
position: for example, in the above scenario, as a player moves from a
`plains` to a `desert` biome, the sky color will gradually shift from red to
yellow. Other attributes, such as `water_evaporates`, represent discrete
values and will not be smoothly transitioned - only the biome exactly at a
subject position will be considered.

Smooth transitions between biomes are based on the biomes within an 8 block
radius of the camera. Biomes that occupy a larger portion of that radius and
are closer to the camera will have a stronger influence on the final
interpolated value.

#### Timelines

Timelines can define Attribute Tracks - these specify how a modifier for a
particular Environment Attribute changes over time by defining keyframes.
Depending on the attribute, interpolation may be used between each keyframe.
If interpolation is not used, the previous keyframe value will always be
selected.

For example, a Timeline with a period of `24000` might be set up as following:

  * At time = `0`, the timeline provides `sky_color = #ff0000` (red)
  * At time = `1000`, the timeline provides `sky_color = #ff0000` (red)
  * At time = `6000`, the timeline provides `sky_color = #ff00ff` (magenta)

Between time = `0` and time = `1000`, the sky color will be red. Between
`1000` and `6000`, it will shift from red to magenta. Then, from `6000` all
the way until the timeline repeats and reaches time = `0` again, the color
will slowly shift back to `red`.

Note: unlike biomes, if a Timeline uses a modifier instead of an override,
interpolation is applied to the modifier arguments rather than the final
modified values.

### Environment Attribute Map

Dimension Type and Biome definitions contain a new `attributes` field,
enabling them to define Environment Attributes.

This map generally takes the form of an object mapping between Environment
Attribute IDs and their corresponding values, for example:

    
    
    "attributes": {
        "minecraft:visual/fog_color": "#ffaa00",
        "minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates": true
    }
    

Values defined as above will always be assumed to use the `override` modifier.

The value object can however be expanded in order to express different
modifiers, in the format of an object with the following fields:

  * `modifier`: optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below)
    * Default: `override`
  * `argument`: the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier)
    * How the argument is used also depends on the type of modifier

For example, the following definition describes multiplying
`water_fog_end_distance` by 85%:

    
    
    "attributes": {
        "minecraft:visual/water_fog_end_distance": {
            "modifier": "multiply",
            "argument": 0.85
        }
    }
    

### Attribute Track

An Attribute Track specified within a Timeline takes the format of an object
with the following fields:

  * `ease` \- optional Easing Type (see below), used to ease the interpolaton of the value between keyframes
    * Default: `linear`
    * If the target attribute does not support interpolation, the easing mode will have no effect
  * `keyframes` \- list of keyframe objects, must be ordered by the `ticks` field:
    * `ticks` \- integer between `0` and `period_ticks` (if specified), defines the tick (within the period) at which this keyframe's value will be active
    * `value` \- the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier)
      * If no `modifier` is specified (or `override` is used), the type of this field is the same as the Environment Attribute itself
      * How this value is used depends on the type of modifier
    * Note: at most two keyframes can be placed on the same tick, creating an immediate transition
  * `modifier` \- optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below)
    * Default: `override`

For example, the following Timeline has a period of `24000`, and has an
attribute track that modifies only
`minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance`. Because the easing is
`constant`, between tick `362` and `23667` the value is `0.0`, while between
tick `23667` and `362` it is `0.7`.

Like other Environment Attribute sources, the specified value is used as the
argument to the specified `modifier`. This is then applied on top of sources
with a lower priority. In this case the modifier is `maximum`, so this
timeline will only ever increase the value of `cat_waking_up_gift_chance` to
the value specified in the track.

    
    
    {
        "period_ticks": 24000,
        "tracks": {
            "minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance": {
                "ease": "constant",
                "modifier": "maximum",
                "keyframes": [
                    { "ticks": 362,   "value": 0.0 },
                    { "ticks": 23667, "value": 0.7 }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    

##### Easing Types

An Easing Type may also be specified with a Cubic Bézier in the format: `{
"cubic_bezier": [ x1, y1, x2, y2 ] }`

  * `x1`: float between `0` and `1`, x-coordinate of the first control point
  * `y1`: float, y-coordinate of the first control point
  * `x2`: float between `0` and `1`, x-coordinate of the second control point
  * `y2`: float, y-coordinate of the second control point

This was and stays the strategy for leaves and Mangrove Roots. It simulates dark interior of the blocks<li><code>cutout</code> is a new strategy that always generates a mipmap based on the original texture instead of the previous mipmap. Used for most cutout blocks that became mipmapped in this version.<li><code>strict_cutout</code> is a modification of <code>cutout</code> that uses stricter alpha cutoff value leading to the textures using this value disappearing at higher mipmap levels. Is used for flowers and similar blocks to avoid artifacts.<li><code>auto</code> is the default value and will make the game to pick <code>mean</code> for textures that do not contain fully transparent pixels and <code>cutout</code> for those that do</ul><li><code>alpha_cutoff_bias</code> is a float field for controling the alpha bias for cutout textures<ul><li>Technically there is no limit for this value, it can be negative as well, but it does not make sense to set this higher than <code>1.0</code> or lower than <code>-1.0</code> since the texture will become either fully opaque or fully transparent<li>Default value for this field is <code>0.0</code>, and it can be increased for textures that can become too transparent/thin at distance, or decreased if it's too "opaque"<li>It's recommended to increment or decrease this value in fine granuality for finding the sweet spot.

  * More debug renderers are now available through the Debug Settings screen
  * Some existing renderers were improved
  * The performance of debug renderers has been significantly improved

## Graphics Presets

  * Settings on the Video Settings screen have been reordered and split into 3 sections: "Display", "Quality & Performance", and "Preferences"

    * "Weather Effect Radius" configures the distance in blocks within which rain and snow are visible
    * "Improved Transparency" resolves some of the transparent geometry rendering issues at a significant GPU cost, previously was hidden behind "Fabulous!"
  * A new "Preset" slider was added to the top of the "Quality & Performance" section
    * Presets, as you would expect based on gaming industry standard, control most of the "Quality & Performance" settings at once, not only the ones that were previously hidden behind the "Graphics" setting
    * Available presets are "Fast", "Fancy", "Fabulous!" and "Custom"
    * The default preset is "Fancy" for new players
    * But for players who are upgrading to this version the preset will be set to "Custom" to preserve your current configuration

  * The Minecraft Server Management Protocol version is now 2.0.0
  * Added ClientFps JFR event
  * Experience packets that do not change the player's experience progress or level are no longer sent by the server
  * Added support for KQueue on OSX to improve network connection performance

## Network Protocol

## Minecraft Server Management Protocol Version 2.0.0

  * Added a new notification `server/activity`
    * Indicates that a network connection to the server has been initiated
    * Rate limited to 1 notification per 30 seconds
  * Enable authentication from web browsers
    * Authenticate by passing the token in `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header when opening the WebSocket connection
      * Example: `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: minecraft-v1, <token>`
    * Requests authenticating this way are subject to Origin header checks. This requires configuration of allowed origins on the server side using `management-server-allowed-origins`. The default value is empty, meaning `Sec-Websocket-Protocol` authentication is effectively disabled
  * In the `typed_game_rule` and `untyped_game_rule` schemas, the type of the `value` field has been changed from string to take either a boolean or an integer
    * Also, it now uses the game rule resource location as the key

# Data Pack Versions 89.0 through 94.1

  * Added `stopwatch` command for keeping track of real time
  * Certain visual and gameplay effects can now be controlled by Environment Attributes
  * World Border interpolation is now dependent on game ticks instead of real time
    * This means the World Border will no longer move when the game is paused
    * It will also respect any changes made by the `/tick` command
  * Changed loot function `filtered` to allow running modification when predicate fails
  * Added `discard` loot function
  * Added new Coral Zombie Nautilus mob variant
    * The Zombie Nautilus variants can be data-driven
  * Item textures were split out of the `blocks` atlas into a separate new `items` atlas
    * It means that the commands that were referencing the `blocks` atlas for item textures now need to reference the `items` atlas instead

## Zombie Nautilus Variants

  * Zombie Nautilus variants can be data-driven by adding entries to `data/<namespace>/zombie_nautilus_variant/<id>.json`
  * This feature is experimental
  * Fields in file:
    * `model` \- one of: `normal`, `warm`
    * `asset_id` \- namespaced id for this variant asset, resolves to `assets/<namespace>/textures/<path>.png`
    * `spawn_conditions` \- a uniform variant selection rule explained below

### Spawn conditions

#### `minecraft:biome`

  * Checks if entity is spawning in specific biomes
  * Fields:
    * `biomes` \- single entry, list or a tag describing biomes

#### `minecraft:moon_brightness`

  * Checks if current moon brightness is within certain range
  * Fields:
    * `range` \- floating point range (a single number or an object like `{"min": 1, "max": 2}`)

#### `minecraft:structures`

  * Checks if entity is spawning in specific structures
  * Fields:
    * `structures` \- single entry, list or a tag describing structures

## Commands

  * Resource suggestions now show results in any namespace instead of just within `minecraft`

### Added `stopwatch`

  * New command that allows the creation of a Stopwatch that keeps track of real time
  * Stopwatches do not depend on game ticks
  * They only run when the server/world is running, even when paused

Syntax:

  * `stopwatch create <id>` \- creates a Stopwatch with the given namespaced ID
  * `stopwatch query <id> [<scale>]` \- shows the elapsed time of the given Stopwatch in seconds and returns it scaled by the given value and truncated.
    * Default scale: `1`
  * `stopwatch restart <id>` \- restarts the given Stopwatch
  * `stopwatch remove <id>` \- removes the given Stopwatch

> **Developer's Note** : _This command is added to replace the need of using world borders to keep track of real time. The intent is to change the world border to be dependent on game ticks in a future snapshot. If you've relied on this way of measuring the passage of real time before, please switch to using the new command and let us know if anything doesn't work as intended. Thank you!_

### Changes to `execute`

  * Added new syntax `/execute if|unless stopwatch <id> <range>`
  * Allows to compare the elapsed time of a given Stopwatch with a floating point value range
    * The Stopwatch value is measured in seconds and has an accuracy of at most a millisecond
    * Example: `/execute if stopwatch foo:bar ..10 run say Stopwatch foo:bar has not reached 10 seconds yet`

### Changes to `worldborder`

  * The `time` arguments now specify ticks by default, but can also specify seconds or in-game days using an `s` or `d` suffix

## Game Rules

Game rules have been moved into a registry. With that, all game rules have been renamed from their previous camel case names to resource locations in snake case.

Additionally, the following game rules have been further renamed:

  * `announceAdvancements` -> `minecraft:show_advancement_messages`
  * `commandBlocksEnabled` -> `minecraft:command_blocks_work`
  * `command_modification_block_limit` -> `minecraft:max_block_modifications`

  * `snowAccumulationHeight` -> `minecraft:max_snow_accumulation_height`
  * `spawnRadius` -> `minecraft:respawn_radius`
  * `spawnerBlocksEnabled` -> `minecraft:spawner_blocks_work`

### Limits

Some game rules that previously did not have a limited value range now do:

  * `minecraft:max_block_modifications`: Minimum `1`
  * `minecraft:max_command_forks`: Minimum `1`

  * `minecraft:respawn_radius`: Minimum `0`

### Added `minecraft:fire_spread_radius_around_player`

  * Controls the maximum distance in blocks that fire can spread around a player
    * This replaces the previous `doFireTick` and `allowFireTicksAwayFromPlayer` game rules, which have now been removed
    * Setting it to `0` will disable fire spreading
    * Setting it to `-1` will allow fire spreading without players around
    * Limit: Minimum `-1`

## Game Tests

In the `game_rules` test environment the keys `bool_rule` and `int_rule` have been replaced with a single key `rules`. It is a map from game rules resource locations to the game rules value. The value type is either integer or boolean depending on the game rule.

## Attributes

## Timelines

Timelines are a new concept defined in data packs under the `timeline` registry (i.e. found under `data/<namespace>/timeline/<id>.json`).

Timelines specify game behavior based on the absolute day time (that which is set by `/time set`). Timelines optionally can specify a period over which they will be repeated.

Primarily, Timelines are able to modify game behavior or visuals by applying Environment Attribute modifiers.

Format: object with fields

  * `period_ticks`: optional integer, defines the duration in ticks over which the timeline will repeat
    * If not specified, the timeline will not repeat
  * `tracks`: optional map between Environment Attribute IDs and a corresponding Environment Attribute Track object
    * See the section on Environment Attributes below for details

Timelines by default have no effect unless they are included by a dimension - see the Dimension Types section below.

## Environment Attributes

Environment Attributes provide a data-driven way to control a variety of visual and gameplay systems.

Each Environment Attribute controls a specific visual or gameplay effect: for example, `minecraft:visual/sky_color` controls the color of the sky, and `minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates` controls whether water can be placed at a given location.

> **Developer’s Note:** _This system and many of the introduced attributes should be considered very experimental, and may still change significantly in coming snapshots and releases. In the meantime, we would as always love to hear any feedback or suggestions you may have!_

### Sources

Environment Attribute values can be provided by the following Environment Attribute sources (in order of low to high priority):

  * Dimensions
  * Biomes
  * Timelines
  * Weather (not data-driven)

While Biomes act as a source to modify an attribute by position, Timelines can modify an attribute based on time.

The "effective" value of the Environment Attribute (i.e. what will actually show up in game) will be some combination of the values provided by each source according to their priority.

For example, in the following scenario:

  * The `overworld` dimension provides `sky_color = #00ff00` (green)
  * The `plains` biome provides `sky_color = #ff0000` (red)

When the player is in the `plains` biome, they will see the red `sky_color`, while anywhere else in the `overworld` they will see green.

When an Environment Attribute source provides an Environment Attribute, it can:

  * Override the value, such as the `plains` biome overriding the `overworld`'s `sky_color` in the above scenario
  * Apply a modifier to a previous value (see section on Modifiers below)

![Pale garden biome that has blue fog, and bubble particles that has been modified with a data pack.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/1.21.11environmentattributes.jpg)

### Modifiers

As described in the above example, an Environment Attribute source may simply override the value of a particular attribute. However, it is sometimes also desirable to rather apply a modifier to a value provided by a source with lower priority.

For example, in the following scenario:

  * The `overworld` dimension provides `water_fog_end_distance = 96.0`
  * The `plains` biome modifies `water_fog_end_distance` with a `multiply` modifier of `0.85`

When in the `plains` biome, the `water_fog_end_distance` will be resolved to `96.0*0.85 = 81.6`, while in any other Overworld biome, it will resolve to `96.0`.

The kinds of modifiers available depends on the type of Environment Attribute. The most basic modifier, supported by every Environment Attribute, is the `override` modifier. This behaves purely as an override of the preceding value. If not specified by an Environment Attribute source, the modifier will always be assumed to be `override`.

Full descriptions of the available modifiers and their behaviors can be found in the Common Modifiers section below.

### Interpolation

While modifiers describe how a value provided by one source is applied on the value from a preceding source, interpolation describes the combination of values within a source. Only some Environment Attributes support interpolation. This allows for the smooth transition between two or more values, such as when moving between two biomes.

Between multiple Biomes, interpolation is performed on values from a source after modifiers have been applied. Within a Timeline, interpolation is performed on the modifier arguments before they get applied.

#### Biomes

For example, in the following scenario:

  * The `plains` biome provides `sky_color = #ff0000` (red)
  * The `desert` biome provides `sky_color = #ffff00` (yellow)

`sky_color` is one such attribute that will transition smoothly based on position: for example, in the above scenario, as a player moves from a `plains` to a `desert` biome, the sky color will gradually shift from red to yellow. Other attributes, such as `water_evaporates`, represent discrete values and will not be smoothly transitioned - only the biome exactly at a subject position will be considered.

Smooth transitions between biomes are based on the biomes within an 8 block radius of the camera. Biomes that occupy a larger portion of that radius and are closer to the camera will have a stronger influence on the final interpolated value.

#### Timelines

Timelines can define Attribute Tracks - these specify how a modifier for a particular Environment Attribute changes over time by defining keyframes. Depending on the attribute, interpolation may be used between each keyframe. If interpolation is not used, the previous keyframe value will always be selected.

For example, a Timeline with a period of `24000` might be set up as following:

  * At time = `0`, the timeline provides `sky_color = #ff0000` (red)
  * At time = `1000`, the timeline provides `sky_color = #ff0000` (red)
  * At time = `6000`, the timeline provides `sky_color = #ff00ff` (magenta)

Between time = `0` and time = `1000`, the sky color will be red. Between `1000` and `6000`, it will shift from red to magenta. Then, from `6000` all the way until the timeline repeats and reaches time = `0` again, the color will slowly shift back to `red`.

Note: unlike biomes, if a Timeline uses a modifier instead of an override, interpolation is applied to the modifier arguments rather than the final modified values.

### Environment Attribute Map

Dimension Type and Biome definitions contain a new `attributes` field, enabling them to define Environment Attributes.

This map generally takes the form of an object mapping between Environment Attribute IDs and their corresponding values, for example:
    
    "attributes": {
        "minecraft:visual/fog_color": "#ffaa00",
        "minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates": true
    }
    
Values defined as above will always be assumed to use the `override` modifier.

The value object can however be expanded in order to express different modifiers, in the format of an object with the following fields:

  * `modifier`: optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below)
    * Default: `override`
  * `argument`: the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier)
    * How the argument is used also depends on the type of modifier

For example, the following definition describes multiplying `water_fog_end_distance` by 85%:
    
    "attributes": {
        "minecraft:visual/water_fog_end_distance": {
            "modifier": "multiply",
            "argument": 0.85
        }
    }
    
### Attribute Track

An Attribute Track specified within a Timeline takes the format of an object with the following fields:

  * `ease` \- optional Easing Type (see below), used to ease the interpolaton of the value between keyframes
    * Default: `linear`
    * If the target attribute does not support interpolation, the easing mode will have no effect
  * `keyframes` \- list of keyframe objects, must be ordered by the `ticks` field:
    * `ticks` \- integer between `0` and `period_ticks` (if specified), defines the tick (within the period) at which this keyframe's value will be active
    * `value` \- the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier)
      * If no `modifier` is specified (or `override` is used), the type of this field is the same as the Environment Attribute itself
      * How this value is used depends on the type of modifier
    * Note: at most two keyframes can be placed on the same tick, creating an immediate transition
  * `modifier` \- optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below)
    * Default: `override`

For example, the following Timeline has a period of `24000`, and has an attribute track that modifies only `minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance`. Because the easing is `constant`, between tick `362` and `23667` the value is `0.0`, while between tick `23667` and `362` it is `0.7`.

Like other Environment Attribute sources, the specified value is used as the argument to the specified `modifier`. This is then applied on top of sources with a lower priority. In this case the modifier is `maximum`, so this timeline will only ever increase the value of `cat_waking_up_gift_chance` to the value specified in the track.
    
    {
        "period_ticks": 24000,
        "tracks": {
            "minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance": {
                "ease": "constant",
                "modifier": "maximum",
                "keyframes": [
                    { "ticks": 362,   "value": 0.0 },
                    { "ticks": 23667, "value": 0.7 }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

This was and stays the default strategy for most solid or translucent full block textures<li><code>dark_cutout</code> is similar to <code>mean</code>, but blends colors in a way that makes the pixels bordering cutout pixels darker. This was and stays the strategy for leaves and Mangrove Roots. It simulates dark interior of the blocks<li><code>cutout</code> is a new strategy that always generates a mipmap based on the original texture instead of the previous mipmap. Used for most cutout blocks that became mipmapped in this version.<li><code>strict_cutout</code> is a modification of <code>cutout</code> that uses stricter alpha cutoff value leading to the textures using this value disappearing at higher mipmap levels. Is used for flowers and similar blocks to avoid artifacts.<li><code>auto</code> is the default value and will make the game to pick <code>mean</code> for textures that do not contain fully transparent pixels and <code>cutout</code> for those that do</ul><li><code>alpha_cutoff_bias</code> is a float field for controling the alpha bias for cutout textures<ul><li>Technically there is no limit for this value, it can be negative as well, but it does not make sense to set this higher than <code>1.0</code> or lower than <code>-1.0</code> since the texture will become either fully opaque or fully transparent<li>Default value for this field is <code>0.0</code>, and it can be increased for textures that can become too transparent/thin at distance, or decreased if it's too "opaque"<li>It's recommended to increment or decrease this value in fine granuality for finding the sweet spot.
