shipping room!

their block models. For the full list of changes, browse the changelog below!

# Technical Changes

  * The Data Pack version is now 93.1
  * The Resource Pack version is now 74.0

# Data Pack Version 93.1

## Item Components

### Default Item Components

Added food properties to the following fish bucket items:

  * `minecraft:cod_bucket`
  * `minecraft:salmon_bucket`
  * `minecraft:pufferfish_bucket`
  * `minecraft:tropical_fish_bucket`

### `minecraft:use_effects`

Added field `interact_vibrations`: boolean, whether using this item emits
`minecraft:item_interact_start` and `minecraft:item_interact_finish` game
events - Default value: `true`

## Loot Tables

Reverted removal of `contents` as a supported value for the
`minecraft:dynamic` loot pool entry

<div class="developer-note">
<strong>Developer's Note:</strong> Support for this value was removed in a previous
snapshot with the introduction of slot sources, which replace its
functionality. Community response however indicated that certain use cases
aren't yet fully covered by slot sources, so we are reverting this removal
until proper alternatives are ready.
</div>


# Resource Pack Version 74.0

  * Textures used for still water and lava are now hardcoded to `minecraft:block/water_still` and `minecraft:block/lava_still`
  * To prepare for future work, the game will now print a warning if any defined sprites in any atlases share a name
  * Block model and state format has been expanded to allow more rotations

## Textures

  * Beacons no longer support translucent textures
  * Added `gui/container/nautilus` used for the Nautilus inventory UI

## UI Sprites

  * Added `container/slot/nautilus_armor_inventory` \- Nautilus icon used in Nautilus inventory UI

## Sound Events

  * Added `entity.zombie_horse.eat`

## Block Models

  * Block model elements can now be rotated around multiple axes
    * Model is first rotated around X, then Y, then Z
    * New fields:
      * `x` \- rotation around axis X in degrees, float, defaults to `0.0`
      * `y` \- rotation around axis Y in degrees, float, defaults to `0.0`
      * `z` \- rotation around axis Z in degrees, float, defaults to `0.0`
    * Existing fields `axis` and `angle` can still be used
      * If both field sets are present, older notation takes presence
  * Existing restriction for angle value limiting them to `[-45, 45]` has been removed
    * Note: Names of faces are not influenced by rotation. Features that depend on them, like culling, will always use original directions

## Block State Model Dispatch

  * Variants in block state dispatch files (defined in `assets/.../blockstates/` can now be also rotated around Z axis
    * New optional field `z` has the same format as existing `x` and `y` fields: an integer with allowed values of `0` (default), `90`, `180` and `270`
    * Rotation around Z axis is applied after X and Y
