> We're starting the week with Pre-Release 4 for Mounts of Mayhem! With this
one, Dispensers can now be part of the Mayhem with the new Mounts, along with
other fixes!
>
> Happy Mining!

# Changes

  * The attack range extension for players in Creative Mode is once again set to 2 blocks
    * This reverts an accidental change that increased the range to 4 or 6 blocks in certain cases

## Nautilus

  * Dispensers can now equip Saddles and Nautilus Armor on tamed Nautiluses and Zombie Nautiluses
  * Dismounting a Nautilus or Zombie Nautilus while on land no longer places the player inside the Nautilus
    * This works given that there is a valid block to place the player on
    * If there is no valid block, the player will be placed inside the Nautilus as before

## Item Components

### Added `minecraft:attack_range`

  * Format: object with fields
    * `min_reach`: float, the minimum distance in blocks from the attacker to the target to be considered valid
      * Default value: `0.0`, valid from `0.0` to `64.0`
    * `max_reach`: float, the maximum distance in blocks from the attacker to the target to be considered valid
      * Default value: `3.0`, valid from `0.0` to `64.0`
    * `min_creative_reach`: float, the minimum distance in blocks from the Creative Mode attacker to the target to be considered valid
      * Default value: `0.0`, valid from `0.0` to `64.0`
    * `max_creative_reach`: float, the maximum distance in blocks from the Creative Mode attacker to the target to be considered valid
      * Default value: `5.0`, valid from `0.0` to `64.0`
