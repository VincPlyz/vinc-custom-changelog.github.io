Charge into the fray on December 9!

This is the moment you’ve all been waiting for: Mounts of Mayhem is launching on December 9, 2025! The arena is ready, the contenders are locked , and the date of the clash is set. I’ve been appointed as the official ringside commentator for today – and I’m going to take my job very seriously. So let’s get a closer look at our challengers!

This is the sort of mayhem that'll be coming with our Mounts of Mayhem drop! ](https://www.minecraft.net/content/dam/minecraftnet/games/minecraft/screenshots/MCV_MountsOfMayhem_DateAnnounce_editorial_body_1280x720_2.jpg)

The challengers aren’t waking into the ring – they’re riding! Is that … normal? I mean, this is the Mounts of Mayhem drop after all, so we should probably expect our mayhem to come in mounted form!  

Spawning in the first corner we have… **the camel husk**! This is the tallest mount, standing at a whopping 2.375 blocks tall – and that isn’t counting its two riders it spawns with: the husk and the parched! 

Camel husk
----------

The camel husk and its two riders – a husk and a parched!

The husk is a familiar foe to anyone who has spent time in Minecraft’s sandier biomes. This hostile mob is immune to sunlight, and when it spawns in atop a camel husk it’s always with a spear in hand! But more on the spear later – we have another contender waving its bow at me. Don’t you dare fire that thing before the clash has started! 

Ahem. From the safety of my freshly-dug dirt hole, I can report that the parched is a new hostile mob that attacks with arrows of Weakness! And they hurt. Like the husk, the parched is immune to sunlight, which means dodging their attacks until the break of dawn won’t be a viable strategy. Hiding in a dirt hole however, is! Actually, I can still hear the parched grumbling so let me dig a little further down...  

Oh! I appear to have hit water. Luckily, this is where our third contender is found: the zombie nautilus!

Zombie Nautilus
---------------

Zombie nautiluses always spawn with a drowned on board! And those drowned carry tridents. Sounds... safe?

These adorable (if undead) underwater mobs spawn in with a drowned rider – wielding a trident! I’ve also heard rumors of a rare zombie nautilus variant, but the developers haven’t told me how to find it. I know! Maybe we can play a game of “warmer warmer, colder colder” to see if we can stumble upon it! I’ll save it for later, because I have an epic clash to cover! 

In the fourth corner, we have… the zombie horse!

Zombie horse
------------

This undead equine said “neigh” to staying as a Creative mode spawn egg, and is now going to spend the nights roaming the Overworld’s forests and plains biomes. What’s worse – it will do so together with a zombie rider! Similar to the husk, zombies riding a zombie horse will also be equipped with a spear. So, let’s talk about this new weapon coming to Minecraft!

Fight back with a new weapon 
-----------------------------

The **spear** is a new tiered weapon coming to Minecraft, meaning you can craft it from wood, copper, iron, gold, diamond – or even Netherite. The spear has two attacks: the jab attack (which I like to call the “please don’t get any closer”–attack) and the charge attack! The charge attack is particularly interesting because it deals more damage depending on how fast you’re moving. Sprint on foot, don your elytra, or grab your favorite steed to test this out!

The spear also comes with a unique Lunge enchantment, which gives players an extra burst of speed, and can be strong enough to knock a rider from its mount. Enchanted spears do consume hunger points depending on their enchantment levels – so make sure to pack a potato or two!  

We have our contenders, now all we need are the champions! That is… \*checks notes\* YOU! Yes, you! And seeing as all our challengers have ridden into the arena, I reckon you should do the same. The question is: which mount will you pick? The classic horse mount, which can now swim and be equipped with Netherite horse armor? Or perhaps the nautilus, which lets you explore underwater at speed and preserves your air supply? Or maybe you have your sights set on some of the undead mounts in this very arena – the camel husk, zombie nautilus, or zombie horse? Then all you’ll need to do is unseat their riders!
