> It's Snapshot Tues- I mean Thursday, everyone! Today, we are kicking off a brand-new Snapshot series and with it comes the first set of features from our upcoming game drop, Mounts of Mayhem! Charge into the fray with the spear, a new weapon with a unique enchantment. Explore the oceans atop your nautilus or claim undead mounts – the zombie horse and zombie nautilus – as your new steeds. Galloping side to side with these new features is both a revamped video settings screen that includes nifty new graphical presets, as well as the new stopwatch command which keeps track of real time. Bug fixes and technical changes round off the meal, as is tradition.

  * New weapon that can be crafted in Wood, Stone, Copper, Iron, Gold, Diamond and Netherite versions
  * Each material has different stats for timing, influencing how fast they are to use
  * Has a minimum reach for damage, being too close to a target will yield no damage

  * Cooldown between attacks
  * Wooden Spears have the fastest cooldown; Netherite the slowest
  * Can hit multiple enemies
  * Does not destroy blocks

### Charge Attack {{< wiki "Spear#Charge_attack" >}}

  * Press and hold the secondary action button to use
  * Damage is based on Spear material, the player’s view angle, and the velocity of both the player and the target
  * While holding down the button, the attack goes through three stages before returning to idle:
    * Engaged: The Spear can deal damage, knockback, and dismount mounted enemies if the speed is above the required thresholds
    * Tired: Indicated by the Spear rotating to a vertical position and shaking. The Spear can deal damage and knockback (but not dismount) if the speed is above the required thresholds
    * Disengaged: Indicated by the Spear being lowered, pointing downwards. The Spear gives damage but not knockback or dismount if the speed is above the required threshold
  * The Spear's range when used by mobs is half of that when used by players, but they can deal damage, dismount and knockback at lower speeds than the players
  * Zombies, Husks and Zombified Piglins know how to charge with a Spear

### Lunge Enchantment {{< wiki "Lunge" >}}

  * Spear exclusive enchantment
  * Only works with the Jab attack
  * When doing a Jab attack with Lunge, it propels the player horizontally in the view direction
  * The view angle needs to be perfectly leveled horizontally to achieve maximum lunge distance
  * Does significant durability damage to the Spear
      - lvl 1: 8 dmg
      - lvl 2: 32 dmg
      - lvl 3: 128 dmg

    * Indicates that a network connection to the server has been initiated
    * Rate limited to 1 notification per 30 seconds

# Data Pack Version 89.0

  * Added `stopwatch` command for keeping track of real time

## Commands

### Added `stopwatch`

  * New command that allows the creation of a Stopwatch that keeps track of real time
  * Stopwatches do not depend on game ticks
  * They only run when the server/world is running, even when paused

Syntax:

  * `stopwatch <id> create` - creates a Stopwatch with the given namespaced ID
  {{< command >}}/stopwatch cc create{{< /command >}}

  * `stopwatch <id> query` - shows the elapsed time in seconds of the given Stopwatch in chat
  {{< command >}}/stopwatch cc query{{< /command >}}

  * `stopwatch <id> restart` - restarts the given Stopwatch
  {{< command >}}/stopwatch cc restart{{< /command >}}

  * `stopwatch <id> remove` - removes the given Stopwatch
  {{< command >}}/stopwatch cc remove{{< /command >}}

<div class="developer-note">
<strong>Developer's Note:</strong> This command is added to replace the need of using
world borders to keep track of real time. The intent is to change the world
border to be dependent on game ticks in a future snapshot. If you've relied
on this way of measuring the passage of real time before, please switch to
using the new command and let us know if anything doesn't work as intended.
Thank you!
</div>

### `execute`

  * Added new syntax `/execute if|unless stopwatch <id> <range>`
  * Allows to compare the elapsed time of a given Stopwatch with a floating point value range
    * The Stopwatch value is measured in seconds and has an accuracy of at most a millisecond
    * Example: `/execute if stopwatch foo:bar ..10 run say Stopwatch foo:bar has not reached 10 seconds yet`

    {{< command >}}/stopwatch cc restart{{< /command >}}

    {{< command >}}/execute if stopwatch cc ..3 run say hi{{< /command >}}

## Item Components

### Added `minecraft:use_effects`

  * Controls how the player behaves when using an item (right mouse click)
  * Format: object with fields
    * `can_sprint`: boolean, whether the player can sprint while using this item

      * Default value: `whack`
    * `duration`: integer, the duration in ticks
      * Default value: `6`
    * e.g. `swing_animation={type:'stab',duration:20}`

    - Break Blocks and See:
    {{< command >}}/give @s minecraft:copper_pickaxe[minecraft:swing_animation={type:whack}]{{< /command >}}

### Changed `minecraft:consumable`

  * The `animation` field has been updated:
    * Renamed `spear` to `trident`
    * Added new `spear` animation

     - {{< command_v2 nowrap="true" >}}/give @s wheat[minecraft:consumable={animation:spear,consume_seconds:9999999},use_effects={sprinting:true,speed_multiplier:1.0}]{{< /command_v2 >}}

### Changed `minecraft:intangible_projectile`

  * Items with this component now show information about it in their tooltip

## Entity Data

  * The `AngryAt` field has been renamed to `angry_at`
  * The `AngerTime` field has been removed
  * An `anger_end_time` (long) field has been added, containing the time anger ends in game ticks

## Damage Types

  * Added a new `minecraft:spear` damage type

## Predicates

#### Component Predicates

* Component predicates (`predicates` field in block, item and entity predicates) now include predicates for checking existence of every component type
* Those predicates are written as `{<component_type>: {}}`
* Such predicate check passes as long as component is present, no matter the actual value
* Existing predicates for specific components remain unchanged
* Example:
  + `{predicates:{written_book_content:{author:"foo"}}` - existing format for matching books
  + `{predicates:{written_book_content:{}}` - special case of above that accepted any value, as long as component existed
  + `{predicates:{instrument:{}}` - checks if component `minecraft:instrument` exists (was not allowed before)

#### Entity Predicates

The `flags` predicate now supports new values:

* `is_in_water`: when an entity is touching water or a bubble column
* `is_fall_flying`: when an entity is gliding with an elytra

#### Item Predicates

* Item predicate in command form (`<item>[predicate~{...},component={...}]`) has been extended to accept empty predicates for any component type
* Similarily to component predicates in data, those empty entries only check for component existence
* Existing shorter syntax for checking component existence remains unchanged
  + That means `*[instrument]` and `*[instrument~{}]` are equivalent

### Enchantments

#### Enchantment Effect Components

* `minecraft:post_piercing_attack`: Effects applying after a piercing attack with an item

#### Enchantment Entity Effects

* `minecraft:apply_impulse`: applies an impulse to the targeted entity
  + `direction` - The first step of determining the impules is applying this vector as local coordinates (the same used by `tp @s ^ ^ ^`) onto the entity look vector
  + `coordinate_scale` - The second step is scaling the resulting vector by this vector on each axis in world space, X, Y and Z
  + `magnitude` - The third step is scaling the resulting vector by this Level-Based Value
* `minecraft:play_sound`: can now support a list of sound event identifiers, one for each level of enchantment. If a level is higher than the number of sounds, the last sound in the list is used

##### Added `EXPONENT`

* Raises the base to the specified power level.
  + `base` - Level-Based Value indicating the base of the exponent.
  + `power` - Level-Based Value indicating the power of the exponent.

### Tags

## Resource Pack Version 70.0

* Unifont has been updated to 17.0.01

## Textures

* `texture` section of `*.mcmeta` files has a new boolean field `darkened_cutout_mipmap`
  + The default value is `false`
  + It is set to true for the block textures that had mipmaps before this version: all Leave types and Mangrove Roots
  + If the field is set to `true` and the texture is cutout the mipmaps will be darkened to emulate the darker interior of the block, this was the behavior for cutout mipmapped blocks before this version
  + Leaving the field unset or setting it to `false` will generate mipmaps without darkening, and it fits well for other types of cutout blocks that do not have dark interior such as flowers, grasses, vines, rails, etc
* Only mipmaps of level 0 and 1 are now animated for block animated textures
* Glass and Glass Pane now support translucent textures
