> Today we are shipping the first pre-release of 1.21.11, the Mounts of Mayhem
drop. From now on, you should mostly see bugs being fixed. In addition to
that, pre-releases don't follow the regular snapshot cadence of releasing on
Tuesdays, so keep an eye out for the next pre-release.

# Changes

  * Added a new graphical option "Texture Filtering"
    * This now controls whether or not Anisotropic Filtering is used
  * The heads of the Nautilus and Zombie Nautilus now clip less through their shells
  * Leather Horse Armor Parity

## Texture Filtering

{{< icat id="vergleich1" >}}


  * New option in Video Settings
  * Controls the method used to sample textures when they are viewed at an angle or from a distance
  * Available values are "None", "RGSS", and "Anisotropic"
  * The default depends on your graphics preset and hardware
  * "RGSS" (Rotated Grid Super Sampling) is a shader-based filtering method that improves texture clarity at a moderate performance cost
    * This is available on all hardware
  * "Anisotropic" is a hardware-based filtering method that provides the best texture clarity
    * The maximum anisotropy may be "2x", "4x", and "8x", controllable by a separate slider
    * If your hardware does not support it, Anisotropic Filtering will do nothing
    * This significantly impacts video memory usage (especially combined with a high mipmap count)

## Spear Weapon

  * Golden Spear is considered a preferred weapon by Piglins
  * You can now continue to deal damage to the target if you keep charging at it after the initial hit, and mobs can do the same
  * Skeleton variants and Drowned can no longer pick up Spears
  * Zombified Piglins now also know how to charge with a Spear

## Items

  * Spawn Eggs are now sorted thematically in the Creative Inventory, according to the following categories:
    * Overworld
      * Farm Animals
      * Mounts
      * Pets
      * Wild Animals
      * Aquatic
      * Miscellaneous
      * Golems
      * Villagers
      * Undead
      * Spiders
      * Monsters
      * Illagers
    * Nether
    * The End
  * Spears are now placed after Swords in the creative inventory

## Advancements

  * The "Mob Kabob" is no longer a challenge advancement

# Technical Changes

  * The Data Pack version is now 94.0
  * The Resource Pack version is now 75.0

# Data Pack Versions 89.0 through 94.0

## Item Components

  * `min_reach`, `max_reach` and `hitbox_margin` have been moved from `minecraft:piercing_weapon` and `minecraft:kinetic_weapon` into a new component `minecraft:attack_range` to allow all melee weapon types to use them

### Added `minecraft:attack_range`

  * Enables a custom attack range when using the item.
  * Overrides the normal entity interaction range for Player.
  * Regular melee attack range is computed for Mobs based on the distance of the target hitbox to their hitbox. This component modifies that distance check by adjusting minimum and maximum padding for the attack hitbox.
  * Mobs using `minecraft:kinetic_weapon` will have their attack range applied in the same way it applies to players
  * Format: object with fields
    * `min_range`: float, the minimum distance in blocks from the attacker to the target to be considered valid
      * Default value: `0.0`, valid from `0.0` to `64.0`
    * `max_range`: float, the maximum distance in blocks from the attacker to the target to be considered valid
      * Default value: `3.0`, valid from `0.0` to `64.0`
    * `hitbox_margin`: float, the margin applied to the target bounding box when checking for valid hitbox collision
      * Default value: `0.3`, valid from `0.0` to `1.0`
    * `mob_factor`: float, the multiplier applied to the `min_range` and `max_range` when checking for valid distance when item is used by a mob
      * Default value: `1.0`, valid from `0.0` to `2.0`

## Tags

### Item Tags

  * Updated `#piglin_preferred_weapons` to include Golden Spears

# Resource Pack Versions 70.0 through 75.0

  * Textures for the Leather Horse Armor item and equipment asset have been split into a tinted base layer and an overlay layer

## Item Sprites

  * Added new item sprites:
    * `item/leather_horse_armor_overlay`

## Textures

  * `texture` section of `*.mcmeta` files has a new `alpha_cutoff_bias` field that controls alpha bias for cutout textures
    * Technically there is no limit for this value, it can be negative as well, but it does not make sense to set this higher than `1.0` or lower than `-1.0` since the texture will become either fully opaque or fully transparent
    * Default value for this field is `0.0`, and it can be increased for textures that can become too transparent/thin at distance, or decreased if it's too "opaque"
    * It's recommended to increment or decrease this value in fine granuality for finding the sweet spot. As an example, `0.1` is used for `kelp` textures in order to prevent them being fully trasparent at distance
    * Only used for lower mips of cutout textures, does not change the alpha of first mip level, and has no effect on other textures

## Entity Textures

  * Added new entity textures:
    * `entity/equipment/horse_body/leather_overlay.png`

## Sounds

  * Updated Swim Sounds for Nautilus, Baby Nautilus, Zombie Nautilus, and Zombie Nautilus
  * Removed sound event that is no longer used:
    * `item.underwater_saddle.equip`
  * Added new sound events for the Nautilus:
    * `entity.baby_nautilus.ambient_land`
    * `entity.baby_nautilus.death_land`
    * `entity.baby_nautilus.hurt_land`
    * `entity.nautilus.ambient_land`
    * `entity.nautilus.dash_land`
    * `entity.nautilus.dash_ready_land`
    * `entity.nautilus.death_land`
    * `entity.nautilus.hurt_land`
    * `entity.zombie_nautilus.ambient_land`
    * `entity.zombie_nautilus.dash_land`
    * `entity.zombie_nautilus.dash_ready_land`
    * `entity.zombie_nautilus.death_land`
    * `entity.zombie_nautilus.hurt_land`
