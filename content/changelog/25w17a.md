# 25w17a

## New Features

> [!info]
 kein bock das ein 2x auf deutsch zu übersetzen ist fast der gleiche changelog von letzer woche nur das es halt nicht mehr Experimental ist

- Added: Option um die Wolken Distance einzustellen
- Added: Locator Bar, ein neues HUD-Element, das die Richtung zu anderen Spielern im Multiplayer anzeigt 
  
## Locator Bar

The Locator Bar is a new default UI element that displays the direction of other players in the world.

If there are no other players in the world the experience bar will display as normal, otherwise if another player is in the world (and that player is not hiding) then the experience bar will appear when experience is gained, otherwise the Locator Bar will display in the same area.

- Multiplayer servers can toggle the Locator Bar with the locatorBar gamerule
- Players can hide by crouching, wearing a mob head or a Carved Pumpkin, or using a Potion of Invisibility
- Players in Spectator Mode are not visible on the Locator Bar
    - However, Spectating player are visible to each other
- Facing other players within a 120 degrees range will display those players as colored indicators on the Locator Bar
    - Other players that are above/below the screen will also display an up/down arrow with their indicator
    - The indicator will change to different sized icons depending on how far away the other Player is
    - Colored indicators are randomized for each player
        - Servers can modify the colors of indicators with the /waypoint command
            - eg: /waypoint modify @s color red to set an indicator to red
        - Players on a team will override their default indicator color with their team color

#### Player Changes

    - Carved Pumpkin

 ### Commands


#### Added waypoint

This is a new command for querying and modifying waypoints.

```
waypoint list

waypoint modify -entity-selector- color -color-
waypoint modify -entity-selector- color hex -hex-color-
waypoint modify -entity-selector- color reset
waypoint modify -entity-selector- style -waypoint_style/resource-
waypoint modify -entity-selector- style reset
```

#### Arguments:

- entity-selector: For selecting entities that are transmitting as waypoints (see waypoint_transmit_range attribute)
- color: Overrides the Locator Bar icon color for this waypoint
- hex -hex-color- arguments are in web format (RRGGBB)
    - Red is either hex F00 or hex FF0000
    - Cornflower blue is hex 6495ED
	- style: For changing the icon spriteset and selection distances
    - set -waypoint_style/resource- changes the style to a specific asset under waypoint_style/
    - reset will restore the default icon behavior of the Locator Bar


Waypoint Styles

These define custom icons to be displayed on the Locator Bar and are within the waypoint_style/ asset directory.

The default implementation is as such:
```
{
  "near_distance": 128,
  "far_distance": 332,
  "sprites": [
    "minecraft:default_0",
    "minecraft:default_1",
    "minecraft:default_2",
    "minecraft:default_3"
  ]
}
```

- near_distance and far_distance are optional and default to the values 128 and 332 respectively.
    - far_distance distance must be greater than near_distance
- Each sprite is searched within the prefix of hud/locator_bar_dot/ (the directory textures/gui/sprites/hud/locator_bar_dot).

### Game Rules

#### Added locatorBar

- Default is true: enabling the Locator Bar
- Changing to false will remove all existing Waypoints from all players
- The Game Rule has been renamed from useLocatorBar during the experiment. This may break minor command related features in worlds created in the previous snapshot.

#### Added waypoint_transmit_range and waypoint_receive_range

- Default: 0.0, Minimum: 0.0, Maximum: 60000000.0
- Players have a default transmission and receive range of 60,000,000
- Mobs with a transmission range above zero will send waypoint packets to nearby receivers that are within that range
- Similarly, receivers only receive waypoints that are inside their receive range (and receive nothing if that range is zero)

Examples:

- /attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_transmit_range base set 0 will prevent a player from transmitting (hiding them)
- /attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_transmit_range base set 80 will only let a player transmit up to 80 blocks (hiding them from players further than that)
- /attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_receive_range base set 0 will prevent a player from receiving (turns off their Locator Bar)
- /attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_receive_range base set 120 will only let a player see Locator Bar dots that are within 120 blocks (hiding all players further than that)

### Waypoint Broadcasting

The Locator Bar works by a server-controlled Waypoint system. Waypoints are received by Players, and connections between Waypoints and Players are managed by the multiplayer server.

- By default, all Players transmit a Waypoint from themselves, and all Players receive all Waypoints
- Individual Players can have their transmission and receive ranges controlled by the waypoint_transmit_range and waypoint_receive_range attributes
