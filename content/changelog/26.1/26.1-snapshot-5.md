### UI

#### Game rules

-   The search bar will now also select gamerules based on description and category in addition to namespaced ID and name

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 98
-   The Resource Pack version is now 79
-   Tags resolved from `minecraft:nbt` text components, with `interpret: false`, are now pretty-printed instead of being flattened into a single `text` component

-   Used in various places that previously required the exact dye item, including mob and block interactions
    -   Note: the presence of this component itself does not enable functionality. The item has to be explicitly allowed for the given functionality, for example by adding it to tags or changing recipe ingredients
