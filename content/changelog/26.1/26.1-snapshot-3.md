>We're back in action with another Snapshot! In this week's release we're making it possible to access game rules from the in-game pause screen, through the new world options button. On the data pack side of things, we're introducing a new concept of world clocks, which is an expansion of the work we did on timelines last year. For more information about world clocks and more, browse the full changelog below.

>Happy mining!

## Changes

-   Additional tweaks to JVM configuration

### Minor Tweaks to Blocks, Items and Entities

-   The Tripwire texture is now rendered as alpha cutout instead of transparent

### UI

#### Debug Screen

-   A `day_count` debug entry has been split from `local_difficulty`

#### Game Rules

-   The Game Rules screen is now accessible in-game through a new World Options screen in the pause menu

    <img src="/vinc-custom-changelog.github.io/images/26.1/snapshot-3/gamerules.png" alt="">

-   A search bar has been added to the top of the Game Rules screen, both in-game and in the world creation menu

#### World Options

The difficulty button in the pause menu has been replaced with a button leading to a new screen - World Options.

-   The World Options screen contains the difficulty button as well as a button for changing Game Rules

    <img src="/vinc-custom-changelog.github.io/images/26.1/snapshot-3/world_options.png" alt="">

-   The Game Rules screen is available for all operators and otherwise disabled

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 97
-   The Resource Pack version is now 78

## Data Pack Version 97

-   Added new block tags
-   Added new fluid tags
-   Changed format of `time` command to work with World Clocks and Timelines
-   Updated `time_check` condition to specify a World Clock

### World Clocks

World Clocks contain an internal time that increases every tick. They can be defined in data packs under the `world_clock` registry (i.e. found under `data/<namespace>/world_clock/<id>.json`)

-   World Clocks can be paused or resumed, and the time of the clock can be changed or queried from the time command
-   Format: object with no fields

### Timelines

-   Added a `clock` field: a World Clock ID, specifies which World Clock the timeline is tied to
    -   This field is required, but to match previous behavior the `minecraft:overworld` clock can be used
-   Added an optional `time_markers` field, an optional map between namespaced Time Marker IDs and either an int or a Time Marker object,
    -   Format:
        -   Non-negative int, the tick that the time marker marks
        -   Or object with fields:
            -   `ticks`: int between `0` and `period_ticks`, the tick that the time marker marks
            -   `show_in_commands`: optional boolean, specifies whether the Time Marker will show up in command suggestions
                -   Default: `false`

#### Time Markers

Time Markers assign a particular name to a specific (optionally repeating) point in time for a specific World Clock. Time Markers replace the previously predetermined names that could be used by `/time set`, for example `day` or `night`.

Time Markers will exist within the context of a specific World Clock. This means that even though the different Time Markers are defined by different Timelines, only one Time Marker can exist with a particular id for a particular World Clock. It also means that two World Clocks can have a Time Marker with the same name.

#### Built-in uses of Time Markers

Some Time Markers are used to drive Vanilla game behavior. Usually, they are configured to not show up in `/time` commands.

-   `minecraft:wake_up_from_sleep` - the time to advance the dimension's default clock to when players in that dimension wake up after sleeping
-   `minecraft:roll_village_siege` - the time of the dimension's default clock at which the random chance for a Zombie Village siege to occur should be evaluated

### Commands

#### Changes to `swing`

-   Both arguments can now be omitted and will fall back to the following defaults:
    -   The entity selector will be `@s` if omitted
    -   Which hand to swing will be `mainhand` if omitted

#### Changes to `time`

-   The `time` command is now based on World Clocks
    -   A clock can be optionally specified as an input for the time command with `time of <clock> ...`
    -   If the clock is not specified (`/time ...` as before), the default clock for the dimension is used
-   The return value (e.g. from `/execute store`) from the `set` and `add` subcommands is now the total elapsed ticks of the clock instead of the current time of day

Syntax:

-   `time [of <clock>] set <time>` - sets the total elapsed ticks of the clock
-   `time [of <clock>] set <timemarker>` - advances the clock forward to the next occurrence of the time marker
    -   For the minecraft:overworld clock, the available time markers are: `day`, `noon`, `night`, and `midnight`
-   `time [of <clock>] add <time>` - adds ticks to the clock, can be a negative or a positive number
-   `time [of <clock>] pause` - pauses the clock
-   `time [of <clock>] resume` - resumes the clock
-   `time [of <clock>] query <timeline>` - displays and returns the current number of ticks within the timeline's period
-   `time [of <clock>] query <timeline>` repetitions - displays and returns the number of times the timeline's period has repeated
-   `time [of <clock>] query time` - displays and returns the total elapsed ticks of the clock
-   `time query gametime` - as before, the total elapsed ticks within the world (unaffected by changes made to clocks using `/time`)

### Game Test Environments

#### Replaced `time_of_day` with `clock_time`

-   Added a new required field `clock`: World Clock ID, the clock within which to set time (from the existing `time` field)

### Predicates

#### `minecraft:time_check` Loot Predicate

-   Added `clock` field: a World Clock ID, specifies which World Clock the time check should be done for

### Recipes

-   `result` field should now be more consistent across all recipe types that contain it
    -   It will now accept short form (e.g. "`minecraft:foo`", which is equivalent to `{"id":"minecraft:foo", "count": 1}`)
    -   For recipe types `smelting`, `blasting`, `smoking` and `campfire_cooking` this field now also accepts `count` field
        - Example:
        <video src="/vinc-custom-changelog.github.io/videos/26.1/snapshot-3/recipe.mp4" muted autoplay loop controls></video>

### World Generation

#### Dimension Types

-   Added field:
    -   `default_clock`: optional World Clock ID
        -   Specifies the default clock that will be used for the `time` command.
            -   If not specified, the `time` command will require an explicit clock argument
        -   Also specifies the clock to which `minecraft:wake_up_from_sleep` and `minecraft:roll_village_siege` time markers apply
            -   If not specified, those time markers will never apply in that dimension

### Tags
