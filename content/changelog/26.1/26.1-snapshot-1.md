> As the year draws to a close, we gather in the shipping room one more time to press the buttons that make snapshots happen! In this final release of 2025 we're (among other things) upgrading our runtime version of Java, giving villager trades the data-driven treatment, and adding a new swing command that swings the arms of entities. Finally, all our builds will now be unobfuscated moving forward.
>
>Did we miss something? Oh, yeah! This snapshot marks the beginning of our new version numbering system for Minecraft on Java Edition. We'll see you next year for more snapshots and the eventual release of what will be Java Edition 26.1!
>
>Happy mining!

## Changes

-   What trades are unlocked by villager professions are now determined using deterministic random sequences, like loot drops and barter loot
-   The algorithm that maps block and sky light levels to how bright things appear on screen has been fully rewritten
-   A new lightmap debug renderer was introduced, which can be enabled using the `F3 + 4` keybind

### Lightmap Algorithm Changes

-   The new algorithm is supposed to mostly provide the same overall results as before, but:
    -   It is simpler and more straightforward, and fixes multiple issues of the previous one, as listed in the Fixed Bugs section below
    -   The Darkness effect and world darkening effect of the Wither fight now works the same way in all dimensions
    -   The Night Vision effect now simply adds ambient light instead of scaling the resulting colors
        -   It means that fully dark areas no longer look brighter than areas lit by block or sky light
    -   More aspects of the algorithm such as block light tint, ambient light color and night vision color are now data-driven through environment attributes, as described in the Data Pack section below

### Lightmap Debug Renderer

-   A new debug renderer for the lightmap was added, which can be enabled using the `F3 + 4` keybind
-   It is mutually exclusive with FPS/TPS and networking charts
-   It shows the lightmap texture in real-time in the bottom right corner of the screen
-   The vertical axis of the texture represent sky light levels (0-15 from bottom to top)
-   The horizontal axis of the texture represent block light levels (0-15 from left to right)
-   The color of each pixel represents the resulting color that will be applied to blocks and entities lit with the corresponding block and sky light levels

### UI

#### Debug Screen

-   The `looking_at_block` and `looking_at_fluid` debug entries no longer show tags
-   New debug entries have been added:
    -   `looking_at_block_tags`
    -   `looking_at_fluid_tags`
    -   `looking_at_entity_tags`

-   Renamed debug entries:
    -   `looking_at_block` -> `looking_at_block_state`
    -   `looking_at_fluid` -> `looking_at_fluid_state`

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 95
-   If a server's disk space is low, a toast will now be shown to server operators
-   The game now requires Java 25
-   The included Java distribution is now the Microsoft build of OpenJDK 25

## Data Pack Version 95

-   Added data-driven registry for villager trades
-   Piglin inventory slots can now be accessed using `piglin.*` similar to how Villager inventories can be accessed using `villager.*`

### Data-driven Villager Trades

Trades offered by Villagers and Wandering Traders are now data-driven and can be customized by datapack developers

#### Villager Trades

-   Present in the `villager_trade` folder, represents a blueprint for trades which is used by Villagers and Wandering Traders to generate actual trades
-   Entry Format:
    -   `wants`, an object representing an item type and number of them needed to trade
        -   `id`, the id of the item
        -   `count`, an optional number provider representing how many of the item is needed for the trade
            -   Defaults to a constant `1`
        -   `components`, an optional component map representing the expected data components on the item
            -   Defaults to an empty map
    -   `additional_wants`, an optional object representing an additional item required by the merchant, has the same format as `wants`
    -   `gives`, an Item Stack representing the resulting item given by the merchant when trading
        -   Uses the existing format for Item Stacks
    -   `given_item_modifiers`, a optional list of Item Modifiers representing modifiers to apply to the item in `gives` such as enchantments or potions, used to add dynamism to the trade rather than hardcoding certain values
        -   Uses the existing format for Item Modifiers (also known as loot modifiers, item functions, loot functions...)
        -   If any of these returns an empty item the entire trade will be discarded
        -   Item Modifier references are not yet supported
        -   If the final item has a `stored_enchantment` component containing an enchantment in the `#double_trade_price` tag, then the count of `wants` is doubled
    -   `max_uses`, an optional number provider representing the maximum number of times a trade may be used
        -   Is set to `1` if the number provider returns a lower value
        -   Defaults to `4`
    -   `reputation_discount`, an number provider representing how much factors such as demand, discounts or penalties affects the cost represented by `wants`
        -   Is set to `0.0` if the number provider returns a lower value
        -   Defaults to `0.0`
    -   `xp`, an optional number provider representing the amount of xp a merchant gets when the trade is done
        -   Is set to `0` if the number provider returns a lower value
        -   Defaults to `1`
    -   `merchant_predicate`, a Predicate representing conditions on the merchant that need to be met for the trade to be offered
        -   Uses the existing format for Predicates (also known as loot conditions)
        -   Predicate references are not yet supported
    -   `double_trade_price_enchantments`, an optional enchantment id, list of namespaced enchantment IDs, or hash-prefixed enchantment tag representing enchantments that will double the additional cost from `minecraft:enchant_randomly` and `minecraft:enchant_with_levels` if they have `include_additional_cost_component` set to `true` and if the item has one of the provided values in its `minecraft:stored_enchantments` component

An example trade of an emerald and a book for an enchanted book offered only by Desert Villagers

```json
{
  "additional_wants": {
    "id": "minecraft:book"
  },
  "double_trade_price_enchantments": "#minecraft:double_trade_price",
  "given_item_modifiers": [
    {
      "function": "minecraft:enchant_randomly",
      "include_additional_cost_component": true,
      "only_compatible": false,
      "options": "#minecraft:trades/desert_common"
    },
    {
      "function": "minecraft:filtered",
      "item_filter": {
        "items": "minecraft:enchanted_book",
        "predicates": {
          "minecraft:stored_enchantments": [
            {}
          ]
        }
      },
      "on_fail": {
        "function": "minecraft:discard"
      }
    }
  ],
  "gives": {
    "count": 1,
    "id": "minecraft:enchanted_book"
  },
  "max_uses": 12.0,
  "merchant_predicate": {
    "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",
    "entity": "this",
    "predicate": {
      "predicates": {
        "minecraft:villager/variant": "minecraft:desert"
      }
    }
  },
  "reputation_discount": 0.2,
  "wants": {
    "id": "minecraft:emerald"
  }
}
```

#### Trade Sets

-   Present in the `trade_set` folder, they're groupings of trades offered by Villagers and Wandering Traders
-   We currently only have hardcoded ones available in `<profession>/level_<level>` for Villagers, as well as `wandering_trader/buying`, `wandering_trader/special`, `wandering_trader/common` for Wandering Traders
-   Entry Format:
    -   `trades`, a villager trade id, list of namespaced villager trade IDs, or hash-prefixed villager trade tag representing the trades that are part of this trade set
    -   `amount`, a number provider representing the amount of trades to be generated from this set when used
        -   If the generated number is greater than the number of available `trades` then it will only generate until all `trades` have been used once, unless `allow_duplicates` is set to `true`
    -   `allow_duplicates`, a boolean representing if the trade set can use the same Villager Trade multiple times to generate trades
        -   Defaults to `false`
    -   `random_sequence`, an optional named random sequence that determines which trades are generated
        -   Defaults to a non-deterministic random sequence

An example trade set offering 2 trades from the `#minecraft:armorer/level_1` tag, allowing duplicates

```json
{
  "amount": 2.0,
  "trades": "#minecraft:armorer/level_1",
  "random_sequence": "minecraft:trade_set/armorer/level_1",
  "allow_duplicates": true
}
```

### Commands

#### Added `SWING`

-   New command that enables swinging of entities arms
-   Not all entities support swing animation. `swing` will succeed for those entities, but clients will only display it when possible
-   For example, this makes it possible to swing Mannequin arms
-   Returns the amount of entities for which a swing was sent

Syntax: `/swing <entity selector> <mainhand|offhand>`

{{< command >}}/swing @n[type=mannequin] mainhand{{< /command >}}

### Environment Attributes

#### `minecraft:visual/block_light_tint`

Tint of the block light. Block light color start as dark grey at low light levels, becomes tinted by this attribute at medium levels and turns white at high levels. By default, it provides the yellowish tint of torches. Bright colors work best for this attribute, with at least one color component being fully bright. The tint applies globally to all light sources visible on the screen. Individual lights can not be tinted differently.

-   Value type: RGB color
-   Default value: `#FFD88C`
-   Modifiers: RGB Color Modifiers
-   Interpolated: yes
-   Resolved at the camera's position

#### `minecraft:visual/ambient_light_color`

Defines both the ambient light tint and brightness. This light is applied to the world at 0 light level. Block and sky light are added on top of it.

-   Value type: RGB color
-   Default values: `#0A0A0A` for the Overworld, `#302821` for the Nether, `#3f473f` for the End
-   Modifiers: RGB Color Modifiers
-   Interpolated: yes
-   Resolved at the camera's position

#### `minecraft:visual/night_vision_color`

This color is used similarly to ambient light color. When the Night Vision effect is active, per-component maximum of `minecraft:visual/night_vision_color` and `minecraft:visual/ambient_light_color` is used as ambient color. Night Vision is not tinted by default.

-   Value type: RGB color
-   Default value: `#999999`
-   Modifiers: RGB Color Modifiers
-   Interpolated: yes
-   Resolved at the camera's position

### Data Components

#### Added `minecraft:set_random_dyes`

-   Additively adds dyes to an item's `minecraft:dyed_color` data component if the item is in the `#dyeable` tag Fields:
-   `conditions` - conditions for the function to apply
-   `number_of_dyes` - number provider representing the number of random dyes out of sixteen to apply to the item
    -   The same dye might be selected repeatedly

    -   Defaults to any potion in the `potions` registry

#### Changed `minecraft:enchant_with_levels`

Now also takes the following field:

-   `include_additional_cost_component` - optional boolean representing if an `minecraft:additional_cost_component` should be added to the item based on the cost of the enchantment
    -   Defaults to `false`
    -   The value is determined by the `levels` number provider and is the same that is used to determine what enchantment level is used for enchanting

#### Changed `minecraft:enchant_randomly`

Now also takes the following field:

-   `include_additional_cost_component` - optional boolean representing if an `minecraft:additional_cost_component` should be added to the item based on the cost of the enchantment
    -   Defaults to `false`
