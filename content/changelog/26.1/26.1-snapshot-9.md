# Minecraft 26.1 Snapshot 9

>A snapshot on a Wednesday, how very nostalgic! We're releasing 26.1 Snapshot 9 today to address two issues introduced in yesterday's snapshot - in particular, a crash that would occur when any entity traveled outside of the vertical boundaries of the world. (That's a total edge-case, right?)
>
>This snapshot also addresses noisy kittens, elevated shadows, and the pre-edit display showing incorrectly when using IME to input text in-game.
>
>The sky is no longer the limit! Happy exploring!
