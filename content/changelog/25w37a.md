## Changes

* OpenGL 3.3 is now required to play the game, up from 3.2. This does not change our posted Minimum Requirements

> **Developer’s Note:** *We do not expect the update to OpenGL version to affect many people, if any at all. Our posted Minimum Requirements has been OpenGL 4.0 since 2017, and OpenGL 3.3 turned 15 years old recently.*

Minor Tweaks to Blocks, Items and Entities

* Fixed a bug where breaking a Shelf while another player is interacting with it could lead to visual bugs in the player inventory

* Copper Golems hitbox has been tweakedThe hitbox is now 0.49 blocks in width to be able to pathfind through narrow spaces

* Copper Golems can now open doors

* Test Instance Blocks now preserve error markers between world reloads

* Ambient lighting on entities has been adjusted to be more visually in line with blocks and other parts of the gameThe underside of flat surfaces will now be lit from that direction, instead of the opposite direction This mainly affects models containing cubes that are either flat or "hollow" such as: 
   - Worn armor
   - Worn Elytra
   - The outside layers on player skins
   - The ribcages of Skeletons or Skeleton Horses
   - The feet of Chickens or Frogs
   - The wings of Phantoms or the Ender Dragon
   - The fins on fish
   - And more!

### Game Mode Switching

- Switching from Spectator Mode to Creative Mode no longer causes the player to stop flying
   - Instead, flight now only gets disabled when switching game modes if the player is near the ground
     - A player is considered to be near the ground if there is a collidable surface (i.e. blocks, Happy Ghasts, boats...) within 1 block below them
   - Flight will not get disabled if the player was inside a block or collidable entity
     - This is to prevent players from suddenly falling through the ground

> **Developer's Note**: *This change is a partial revert of a bugfix from a previous snapshot. Even though the old behavior prior to the fix was unintended, the approach we took to fixing flight didn't quite land the way we wanted it to. In response to community feedback, we're trying this new approach as a less disruptive alternative.*

### Minecraft Server Management Protocol

- Clients must authenticate to access the API
   - Clients should supply an `Authorization` bearer token header with a server specific secret
   - The secret is configured in the server properties file
     - `management-server-secret=`
     - The secret should be exactly 40 alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9)
     - The secret will be automatically generated if the server property is empty
     - Unauthorized requests are rejected with 401 Unauthorized

- TLS is enabled by default
   - Can be disabled in the server properties file
     - `management-server-tls-enabled=false`

   - Requires a keystore file to be set in the server properties file
     - `management-server-tls-keystore=path/to/keystore.p12`

   - The keystore file must be in PKCS12 format
   - Keystore password can be set in the following ways, in order of priority
     - Environment variable: `MINECRAFT_MANAGEMENT_TLS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
     - JVM argument: `-Dmanagement.tls.keystore.password=`
     - Server property: `management-server-tls-keystore-password=`

### Server Properties

- Default value of `management-server-port` was changed from `25585` to `0`, assigning an available port each time management server is started
- Added server property management-server-tls-enabled controlling whether the Minecraft Server Management Protocol uses TLS or not
   - Defaults to `true`
- Added server property `management-server-tls-keystore` controlling the path to the keystore file used for TLS
   - Defaults to an empty string
   - A dedicated server won't start when TLS is enabled and no keystore is provided
- Added server property `management-server-tls-keystore-password` controlling the password to the keystore file used for TLS
   - Defaults to an empty string

### Game Rules

- Added `spawnerBlocksEnabled` game rule controlling if Spawner Blocks should be enabled or not
   - Defaults to `true`

### Mob Spawning

- Logic for choosing type of equipment for mobs spawning with equipment has been tweaked to add Copper as a possibility
   - The initial roll to choose a type now chooses between Leather, Copper and Gold
   - The chance to increase an armor tier has increased from 9.5% to 10.87%

### Sounds

- Some sound sliders in the Music & Sound Options now play a preview sound when adjusting the setting outside a world

### UI

- The Resource Pack and Data Pack selection screens now have a search box

<video src="/vinc-custom-changelog.github.io/videos/25w37a/rp_and_dp_search.mp4" controls></video>

## Technical Changes

- The Data Pack version is now 87.0

- The Resource Pack version is now 69.0

- Some previously hidden debug features have been exposed to players

### Debug features

- Some debug features that were previously removed during compilation are now preserved and can be used by players
- Individual values can be enabled with JVM properties:
   - First, a global debug flag must be enabled with `-DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED` or `-DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED=true`
   - Then, a specific feature can be enabled, for example `-DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN` or `-DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN=true`
   - To get the list of all available debug properties, add `-DMC_DEBUG_PRINT_PROPERTIES`

> Warning: this is debug code. Handle with extreme care!
>   - This is an advanced feature, meant to help modders - it should not be used for normal play
>   - Features not guaranteed to work as intended
>   - It might crash your game or corrupt your worlds
>   - Individual options might be added, changed or removed without a notice
