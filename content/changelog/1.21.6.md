> Experience the joy of soaring above the Overworld with our Chase the Skies
drop! This drop not only brings an exciting flying mount to Minecraft but
opens up the skies for exploring, building – and more. Raise your ghastling
with care and it'll let you soar with friends above the clouds once fully
grown.

With 1.21.6 we are also taking steps towards adding Vibrant Visuals to Java.
In this release, there are new fog improvements and clouds will extend all the
way to the horizon.

Go out and explore the Overworld, build high into the sky, leash a caravan of
camels together, uncover new music, and find wandering friends with the Player
Locator bar.

## Happy Ghast

The Happy Ghast is a new mountable flying mob.

### Dried Ghast Block

  * The Dried Ghast block is found in Nether Fossil structures and is the first stage of the Happy Ghast mob
  * Can be crafted with 1 Soul Sand block and 8 Ghast Tears
  * When waterlogged, it undergoes 3 hydration level changes over approximately 20 minutes until it spawns a Ghastling mob
  * The hydration level decreases when it is no longer waterlogged, using the same timescale
  * The hydration level is not preserved when mined
  * Makes sounds and shows particles depending on its hydration level
  * The Dried Ghast block emits a vibration frequency of 11 when its block state changes

### Ghastling Mob

  * The Ghastling is a young version of the Happy Ghast mob
  * Spawns from a Dried Ghast block that has continuously been waterlogged for about 20 minutes
  * After spawning, the Ghastling will try and follow:
    * Players within a 16-block radius or
    * An adult, non-aquatic passive mob or some of the neutral mobs within a 16-block radius
  * If no player or suitable mob is close around, the Ghastling will idle around within 32 blocks from its home position where it spawned or was last interacted with
    * It will reset its home position if it is moved more than 16 blocks away from the border of its home position
  * Can be tempted and fed using Snowballs
  * Will grow up into a Happy Ghast after about 20 minutes, or faster if fed Snowballs

Efe. A stay cat is also quite curious of what Efe is holding in their
hands.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/1.21.6ghastlingscaled.jpg)

### Happy Ghast Mob

  * Can be equipped with a Harness and then be mounted by up to four players
  * Tempted by Snowballs and Harness
    * The Happy Ghast can only be tempted with a Harness when it has no harness equipped
  * Slowly regenerates health, with regeneration speeding up during rain, snow or when flying at the same height as clouds
  * The first player that mounts the Happy Ghast will control it, sitting above it in the front seat
    * When controlled, the goggles of the Happy Ghast flip down to cover its eyes
  * Players mounting after the first player are placed in slots on each side of it, starting clockwise from the first player
  * Pressing the sneak key dismounts the player on top of the Happy Ghast
  * If the Happy Ghast detects players standing on top of it, it ceases all movement and rotates to the closest cardinal direction
    * This happens regardless of whether it has a Harness equipped or not
  * When mounted on the Happy Ghast, the third-person camera is further away from the player
  * When there are no players mounted or walking on the Happy Ghast, it starts its roaming behavior
    * If players dismount midair, the Happy Ghast will descend towards the ground before it starts roaming
    * The roaming behavior is similar to the Ghastling, except for the radius being 64 blocks
    * When wearing a Harness, the Happy Ghast roams closer to the home position, within a 32 block radius
    * When leashed, the Happy Ghast has a roaming distance of 10 blocks
    * The Happy Ghast will try to stay close to blocks when roaming
  * Cannot be bred
  * Cannot enter boats
  * Has no panic behavior when taking damage

### Harness Item

  * The Harness is a new item that can be equipped on a Happy Ghast to allow players to ride it
  * The Harness comes in 16 different colors
  * Can be crafted out of 3 Leather, 2 Glass blocks and 1 Wool block
    * The Harness will have the same color as the Wool block used when crafting
  * Can be re-dyed in the crafting grid
  * Can only be equipped on a Happy Ghast
  * Allows up to 4 players to mount the Happy Ghast
  * Can be removed from the Happy Ghast using Shears when no players are mounted

## Locator Bar

The Locator Bar is a new UI element that displays the direction of other
players in the world.

  * If another player is in the world (and that player is not hiding) the Locator Bar will display in the same area as experience bar
    * When experience is gained the experience bar will appear
    * If there are no other players in the world the experience bar will display as normal
  * Facing other players within a 120 degree range will display those players as colored indicators on the Locator Bar
    * Other players that are above/below the screen will also display an up/down arrow together with their indicator
    * The indicator will change to different sized icons depending on how far away the other Player is
    * Colored indicators are randomized for each player
      * Operators can modify the colors of indicators with the `/waypoint` command
        * e.g.: `/waypoint modify @s color red` to set an indicator to red
      * Players on a team will override their default indicator color with their team color
  * Players can hide by crouching, wearing a mob head or a Carved Pumpkin, or using a Potion of Invisibility
  * Players in Spectator Mode are not visible on the Locator Bar
    * However, spectators are visible to each other
  * The Locator Bar can be toggled off by setting the `locatorBar` game rule to `false`

## Projectile Targeting

  * The target tolerance margin of projectiles now changes over time
    * Previously, all projectiles had a target tolerance margin of 0.3 blocks
    * Now, all projectiles start with no margin for the first two ticks of their flight
    * After that, the target margin will expand by 0.05 blocks per tick until it reaches the previous 0.3 blocks margin
    * This allows for better precision close to the shooting player or entity, while still allowing for some collision leeway when the projectile is further away

## Splash Potions

  * Splash Potions distance to affected entities now depends on the closest distance between the entity hitbox and the splash potion hitbox where it landed
    * This means that if an entity is hit directly by the splash potion, it will receive the full effect of the potion

feature</ul><h5><code>minecraft:custom_options</code></h5><ul><li>Shows contents of <code>minecraft:pause_screen_additions</code> tag (see below)<li>Allows the user to select a specific dialog if this tag contains multiple entries<li>Note: Since this tag is meant for interoperability, any content that replaces this dialog should be careful not to hide other dialog providers</ul><h3>Dialog Command</h3><ul><li>New command has been added to show dialog to clients</ul><p>Syntax:<ul><li><code>dialog show &#60targets> &#60dialog></code> - show dialog to player(s)<ul><li><code>&#60targets></code> - player name, UUID or a player selector<li><code>&#60dialog></code> - a namespaced ID from <code>minecraft:dialog</code> registry or inline dialog value as

according to the same rules<li>Buttons leading to dialogs exposed in this way will use label described in <code>external_title</code> field<li>This feature is configured by <code>minecraft:pause_screen_additions</code> dialog tag:<ul><li>If this tag is not specified or is empty but the server has sent <code>server_links</code> packet, the tag will be handled as if it contained <code>minecraft:server_links</code> dialog<ul><li>Note: this matches previous Server Links feature behavior<li>If this dialog is removed, the tag remains empty</ul><li>If this tag is still empty, the button will not be visible ("Send Feedback" and "Report Bugs" buttons are visible instead)<li>If this tag has a single element, the pause screen button will lead directly to that dialog<li>If this tag has multiple elements, the pause screen button will lead to a <code>minecraft:custom_options</code> dialog which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements<ul><li>If this dialog is removed, the button is will not be visible</ul></ul></ul><h3>Quick Actions Key Bind</h3><ul><li>A new key bind has been added that allows users to access a set of dialogs<li>Default key: <code>G</code><li>This feature is configured by <code>minecraft:quick_actions</code> dialog tag<ul><li>If this tag is empty, the key bind will do nothing<li>If this tag has a single element, the key bind will open that dialog<li>If this tag has multiple elements, the key bind will lead to <code>minecraft:quick_actions</code> dialog which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements<ul><li>If this dialog is removed, the key bind will do nothing</ul></ul><li>This option is intended for use in custom content and by servers, so this tag is empty in the Vanilla pack</ul><h2>Text Components</h2><h3>Click Events</h3><ul><li>Users will now be prompted for confirmation before executing a command from the <code>run_command</code> click action in books and chat if

0</code> will prevent a player from transmitting (hiding them)<li><p><code>/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_transmit_range base set 80</code> will only let a player transmit up to 80 blocks (hiding them from players further than that)<li><p><code>/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_receive_range base set 0</code> will prevent a player from receiving (turns off their Locator

These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future.</em></blockquote><ul><li>All built-in uniforms are now uniform blocks instead of opaque loose uniforms<li>Custom uniforms
