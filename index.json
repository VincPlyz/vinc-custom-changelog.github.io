The Happy Ghast is a new mountable flying mob.\nDried Ghast Block # The Dried Ghast block is found in Nether Fossil structures and is the first stage of the Happy Ghast mob Can be crafted with 1 Soul Sand block and 8 Ghast Tears When waterlogged, it undergoes 3 hydration level changes over approximately 20 minutes until it spawns a Ghastling mob The hydration level decreases when it is no longer waterlogged, using the same timescale The hydration level is not preserved when mined Makes sounds and shows particles depending on its hydration level The Dried Ghast block emits a vibration frequency of 11 when its block state changes Ghastling Mob # The Ghastling is a young version of the Happy Ghast mob Spawns from a Dried Ghast block that has continuously been waterlogged for about 20 minutes After spawning, the Ghastling will try and follow: Players within a 16-block radius or An adult, non-aquatic passive mob or some of the neutral mobs within a 16-block radius If no player or suitable mob is close around, the Ghastling will idle around within 32 blocks from its home position where it spawned or was last interacted with It will reset its home position if it is moved more than 16 blocks away from the border of its home position Can be tempted and fed using Snowballs Will grow up into a Happy Ghast after about 20 minutes, or faster if fed Snowballs Happy Ghast Mob # Can be equipped with a Harness and then be mounted by up to four players Tempted by Snowballs and Harness The Happy Ghast can only be tempted with a Harness when it has no harness equipped Slowly regenerates health, with regeneration speeding up during rain, snow or when flying at the same height as clouds The first player that mounts the Happy Ghast will control it, sitting above it in the front seat When controlled, the goggles of the Happy Ghast flip down to cover its eyes Players mounting after the first player are placed in slots on each side of it, starting clockwise from the first player Pressing the sneak key dismounts the player on top of the Happy Ghast If the Happy Ghast detects players standing on top of it, it ceases all movement and rotates to the closest cardinal direction This happens regardless of whether it has a Harness equipped or not When mounted on the Happy Ghast, the third-person camera is further away from the player When there are no players mounted or walking on the Happy Ghast, it starts its roaming behavior If players dismount midair, the Happy Ghast will descend towards the ground before it starts roaming The roaming behavior is similar to the Ghastling, except for the radius being 64 blocks When wearing a Harness, the Happy Ghast roams closer to the home position, within a 32 block radius When leashed, the Happy Ghast has a roaming distance of 10 blocks The Happy Ghast will try to stay close to blocks when roaming Cannot be bred Cannot enter boats Has no panic behavior when taking damage Harness Item # The Harness is a new item that can be equipped on a Happy Ghast to allow players to ride it The Harness comes in 16 different colors Can be crafted out of 3 Leather, 2 Glass blocks and 1 Wool block The Harness will have the same color as the Wool block used when crafting Can be re-dyed in the crafting grid Can only be equipped on a Happy Ghast Allows up to 4 players to mount the Happy Ghast Can be removed from the Happy Ghast using Shears when no players are mounted Locator Bar # The Locator Bar is a new UI element that displays the direction of other players in the world.\nIf another player is in the world (and that player is not hiding) the Locator Bar will display in the same area as experience bar When experience is gained the experience bar will appear If there are no other players in the world the experience bar will display as normal Facing other players within a 120 degree range will display those players as colored indicators on the Locator Bar Other players that are above/below the screen will also display an up/down arrow together with their indicator The indicator will change to different sized icons depending on how far away the other Player is Colored indicators are randomized for each player Operators can modify the colors of indicators with the /waypoint command e.g.: /waypoint modify @s color red to set an indicator to red Players on a team will override their default indicator color with their team color Players can hide by crouching, wearing a mob head or a Carved Pumpkin, or using a Potion of Invisibility Players in Spectator Mode are not visible on the Locator Bar However, spectators are visible to each other The Locator Bar can be toggled off by setting the locatorBar game rule to false Music and Sound # Added a new music disc: \u0026ldquo;Tears\u0026rdquo; by Amos Roddy Can be obtained by killing a Ghast with a Fireball deflected by a Player Has a comparator output of 10 when played in a Jukebox Added 5 new background music tracks by Amos Roddy: \u0026ldquo;Below and Above\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Broken Clocks\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Fireflies\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Lilypad\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;O\u0026rsquo;s Piano\u0026rdquo; Added a new sound for when a Lead snaps Added new custom sounds for shearing Saddles, Horse Armor, and Carpets from Llamas Added new sound volume category called \u0026ldquo;UI\u0026rdquo; for sounds played by UI elements, like button clicks Music now plays even when the game is paused Added an option to the Music \u0026amp; Sound settings that allows players to change how frequently music plays while in a game world Added an option to the Music \u0026amp; Sound settings that enables a music toast to be shown whenever a song starts playing With this option enabled, the song that is currently playing will always be seen in the top left corner of the in-game Pause Menu Advancements # Added new \u0026ldquo;Stay Hydrated!\u0026rdquo; Husbandry Advancement when a Dried Ghast block is placed into Water Added \u0026ldquo;Heart Transplanter\u0026rdquo; Adventure Advancement that is unlocked when a player places a Creaking Heart with the correct alignment between two Pale Oak Log blocks Changes # Changed leash mechanics and updated recipe for Lead Saddles are now craftable and shearable Updated Ghast texture Improvements to fog Updates to music and sound Improvements to the Realms configuration screen and introduced a region preference setting Piglins can now give Dried Ghast blocks when bartered with Splash Potions effect strength is now based on the distance of the hitboxes The target tolerance margin of projectiles now changes over time Changed Elytra so that while gliding, using a Firework Rocket will only be used as a boost even if it could be placed on a block Spectators will now teleport together with entities that move to other dimensions, but will stop spectating them Increased the third-person camera distance when spectating or riding Ghasts or Ender Dragons The fix to MC-3697 has been partially reverted Decorative hanging entities such as paintings and item frames are now immune to explosions from submerged TNT while items and armor stands are once again vulnerable to them Wolves, Sheep and Pigs now have their legs mirrored The test framework will no longer try to restart running tests after a server restart Clouds now exist all the way to the horizon, with an option to reduce them Updated the pattern of clouds in the sky Horses, Donkeys, and Mules can now be fed Carrots to heal, grow, and improve their temper Updated the main screen panorama Removed Herobrine Leash Changes # The Slime Ball in the Lead recipe has been replaced with a String Improved leash mechanics, with reworked leash physics, allowing for more stable leash connection, especially when leashed entities are not on ground When dragged on the leash, leashed objects will now orient themselves towards the entity holding the leash Using a Firework Rocket when flying with leashed entities will now break the leash connections Leashes are now rendered twice as thick, matching Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Leashes can now be used to leash two mobs together Sneak-interact on any mob while holding leashed mobs will leash these mobs to the entity interacted with Re-leashing an entity is prevented if the re-leashing would result in immediate leash snapping due to distance Leashes can be snipped from an entity when interacting with them using Shears This applies to its own leash connection as well as all entities attached to it Dispensers can now snip leashes from entities in front of them when they are equipped with Shears When leashing an already leashed mob, their previous leash snaps You cannot steal leashed entities from other players Interactions with a Leash Knot/Fences: Fails for entities that are not in range of the Leash Knot/Fence All entities leashed to the player will be leashed to the Leash Knot/Fence Transfers all its leashed entities to the player if the player has no entities leashed Sneak-interact only ever attaches leashes Shearing or punching the Leash Knot will result in all current connections to be broken A Leash Knot requires at least one connection to exist Boats and large mobs that can be leashed but cannot fit in a Boat (Horses, Donkey, Mule, Camel and Sniffer) can be leashed in a special quad connection to the Happy Ghast Happy Ghast will also show a custom layer when it\u0026rsquo;s leashing something using a quad connection Entities leashed in quad connection are now rendered without slack Leash snapping distance has been changed from 10 to 12 blocks Happy Ghast has a leash snapping distance of 16 blocks The distance between two leashed entities is determined based on the center of their bounding boxes, rather than their feet Saddle Changes # Crafting Saddles # Saddles can now be crafted with 3 Leather and 1 Iron Ingot The recipe is unlocked when a player picks up their first Leather Removing Saddles and Equipment # Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses and Carpets can now be removed from the mobs by using Shears This does not work in case the mob has a rider, or if the player is crouching Saddles cannot be removed from Ravagers using Shears Dispensers with Shears cannot remove Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses or Carpets equipped on mobs Shearing Saddles, Horse Armor, and Carpets will emit a vibration frequency of 6, along with the Unequip frequency of 4 Loot Table Changes # The following loot tables have had Saddles removed from them and replaced with 1-5 Leather:\nMonster Room chests Ancient City chests Desert Pyramid chests Jungle Pyramid chests Stronghold altar chests Fog # Fog was tweaked for improved atmospheric perspective It now becomes foggier when it rains Fog is now applied to 3D HUD elements such as first-person player hands and items in hands Ambient Desert Block Sounds Changes # Ambient sand sounds no longer require sky access to play Ambient sand sounds now have a slightly decreased chance to play Terracotta blocks no longer trigger ambient sand sounds Sand blocks no longer trigger ambient wind sounds Terracotta blocks no longer trigger ambient wind sounds Short Dry Grass and Tall Dry Grass can now trigger ambient wind sounds when above 2 Sand, Red Sand or Terracotta blocks Dead Bush ambient sounds now have a slightly increased chance of playing Music and Sound # The following sound categories have been renamed: Friendly Creatures -\u0026gt; Friendly Mobs Hostile Creatures -\u0026gt; Hostile Mobs Rules for when ambient desert blocks sounds play have been tweaked Realms # Changed the layout of the Realms configuration screen to use tabs The Worlds tab allows changes to any of the world slots, creating new worlds and changing their settings The Players tab allows management of the players that have access and their level of access to the Realm The Subscription tab allows management of the Realms subscription The Settings tab allows changing the settings of the Realm Introduced a Region Preference setting that allows for more granular control over what region a Realm is hosted in Changed wording for Close/Open Realm to Temporarily close/Reopen Realm Added the Realms logo to the Realms loading screens Added region information when connecting to a Realm Projectile Targeting # The target tolerance margin of projectiles now changes over time Previously, all projectiles had a target tolerance margin of 0.3 blocks Now, all projectiles start with no margin for the first two ticks of their flight After that, the target margin will expand by 0.05 blocks per tick until it reaches the previous 0.3 blocks margin This allows for better precision close to the shooting player or entity, while still allowing for some collision leeway when the projectile is further away Splash Potions # Splash Potions distance to affected entities now depends on the closest distance between the entity hitbox and the splash potion hitbox where it landed This means that if an entity is hit directly by the splash potion, it will receive the full effect of the potion If the entities are grouped together, they will receive the same effect strength Technical Changes # The Data Pack version is now 80 The Resource Pack version is now 63 All JSON files (in worlds, packs, configuration, etc.) are now parsed in strict mode Pressing F3 + V now prints client-side version information \u0026ldquo;Command Syntax\u0026rdquo; report now contains information about required permission level --quickPlaySingleplayer command line argument can now be used without an identifier to launch into the last played world Data Pack Versions 72 Through 80 #

when placed next to each other, up to 3 powered Shelves will connect\nInteracting with a single powered Shelf swaps all its contents with the 3 rightmost items in the player\u0026rsquo;s hotbar Interacting with two connected Shelves swaps their contents with the 6 rightmost items in the player\u0026rsquo;s hotbar Interacting with three connected Shelves swaps their contents with all items in the player\u0026rsquo;s hotbar It does not matter which of the connected Shelves the player interacts with Accessibility # The \u0026ldquo;Attack/Destroy\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Use Item/Place Block\u0026rdquo; keybinds are now toggleable, meaning they can be set to either \u0026ldquo;Hold\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Toggle\u0026rdquo; in the Controls screen Added \u0026ldquo;Invert Mouse X\u0026rdquo; option to the Mouse Settings screen, which inverts the mouse x-axis Added \u0026ldquo;Sprint Window\u0026rdquo; option to the Controls screen, which represents the time window in ticks where double-tapping the forward key activates sprint Changes # Monster Spawn Eggs now have a tooltip warning when the difficulty is set to Peaceful The mob no longer spawns for one tick when an attempt is made to use the Spawn Egg The debug screen was reworked to be less cluttered and more configurable Changes to world loading and the \u0026ldquo;Spawn Chunks\u0026rdquo; A dimension that has any player activity, forceloaded chunks, active portals, or Ender Pearls in flight will be considered \u0026ldquo;active\u0026rdquo; and will keep processing chunks and entities Previously, this would only apply if a player was in the dimension or a chunk was forceloaded World Loading and Spawn Chunks # The concept of fixed \u0026ldquo;Spawn Chunks\u0026rdquo; has been removed The game will ensure that the following chunks are fully loaded before the player joins or the server starts, in the same way as spawn chunks formerly were: Chunks loaded by the forceload command Chunks active due to portal activity Ender Pearls thrown in Singleplayer (Singleplayer only) The small area of chunks around the player (Singleplayer only) Chunks required to assign the global world spawn (World creation only) The world loading screen now shows the chunks that the player is about to be placed into, rather than chunks loaded around world spawn The loading screen additionally now includes a progress bar This progress bar accounts for all kinds of chunk loading as mentioned above Developer's Note: Developer’s Note: Spawn chunks incur a memory and performance cost for all players and have outlived their initial technical purpose of keeping the spawn area ready for players to quickly join into. However, we also want to recognise that spawn chunks have enabled a multitude of clever contraptions and farms throughout the years, so simply removing them without having other mechanics in the game enable these designs was never an option. We believe that the niche held by spawn chunks has now been filled by alternative methods of chunk loading, such as using portals or ender pearls, particularly with the changes in this snapshot to how the game loads these chunks before the world starts ticking. Sounds # Happy ghast is now audible from 64 blocks Sounds for chests now plays at a lower volume The volume at which a sound is played at now respects the sound source volume value The \u0026ldquo;Voice/Speech\u0026rdquo; sound source has been rephrased to \u0026ldquo;Narrator/Voice\u0026rdquo; UI # Debug Screen # The debug screen is accessible by pressing F3, as before It can now be accessed from everywhere in the game, not only when in a game world It now displays less information by default Added a new Debug Options screen which can be opened by pressing F3 + F5 It can be used to configure which debug information should be displayed For each item you can choose if it should be turned off, visible when the debug screen (F3) is open, or it should always be visible, even when the debug screen is closed Some debug features that were previously available, like chunk border rendering or entity hitbox rendering, can now be toggled through this debug options screen Some debug features that were not previously available to the community, like Octree visualization, are now accessible through the debug options screen The state of the debug options screen is saved between the launches of the game The debug options screen has the following preset profiles: Default resets everything to the default state Performance shows simple performance metrics, including the FPS meter always visible on screen Developer's Note: Previously the information gathering every frame to render the F3 screen had a significant performance cost. So opening the screen to check you FPS noticably dropped the FPS. Now checking your FPS in `Performance` profile should not affect game performance. Accessibility # A button leading to the Controls screen has been added to the Accessibility Settings screen\nThe \u0026ldquo;Auto-Jump\u0026rdquo; option, as well as the \u0026ldquo;Sneak\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Sprint\u0026rdquo; toggles have been removed from the Accessibility Settings screen The \u0026ldquo;Show Subtitles\u0026rdquo; option has been rephrased to \u0026ldquo;Closed Captions\u0026rdquo; to more accurately describe what it does\nDye Colors now have updated icons\nThe goal with these is to enhance visual cohesion across the dye set while maintaining distinct shapes to support colorblind accessibility Performance Improvements # Entity rendering order was improved for significantly better performance You’ll notice much smoother gameplay in areas with lots of mobs, like mob farms FPS won’t improve much if most of your lag comes from things other than entities, like playing with high render distance while not being near many mobs Developer's Note: This change is quite big, and we would not be surprised if we introduced some ordering issues with this. For example, some part of some mob rendering too early or too late and is not visible or is visually broken. Please play around with this and report the bugs you encounter! Technical Changes # Pack versions now have minor versions The Data Pack version is now 82.0 The Resource Pack version is now 65.0 Pack Formats # The pack versions for data packs and resource packs now have minor versions A minor version increment of the game\u0026rsquo;s pack version is backwards-compatible, meaning all packs made for previous iterations of the same major version will keep working Packs can set compatibility requirements on minor versions in case they rely on resources introduced in a minor version Pack Metadata # The pack.mcmeta format has been updated:\nThe supported_formats field has been removed If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed The pack_format field is now optional If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required Added required field min_format - specifies the minimum version supported A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g [74, 1] Specifying a single integer is interpreted as that major version, e.g. 74 is the same thing as [74, 0] Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone Added required field max_format - specified the maximum version supported A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g [74, 1] Specifying a single integer is interpreted as any minor version, i.e. the minor version is 0x7fffffff Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone For overlay entries: The formats field has been removed If your pack includes any overlay range that includes a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required for all overlay definitions Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed Added required field min_format and max_format with the same formats the fields above with the same name for the pack section Example:\n{ \u0026#34;pack\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Pack.mcmeta example\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pack_format\u0026#34;: 90, \u0026#34;min_format\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;max_format\u0026#34;: 99 } } Data Pack Version 82.0 # Commands # The summon command now fails when trying to summon monsters while the difficulty is set to Peaceful Game Rules # Removed spawnChunkRadius game rule Data Components # blocks_attacks Item Component # If the damage reduced in an attack is 0, for example by angle threshold not matching, the item can no longer get disabled in the attack, nor cause knockback due to blocking Loot Tables # Added minecraft:entity_interact loot table type which takes the following parameters: target_entity, the entity being interacted with interacting_entity, the optional entity that is interacting with the target_entity tool, the tool used to interact with target_entity Added minecraft:block_interact loot table type which takes the following parameters: block_state, the block state of the block entity being interacted with block_entity, the optional block entity being interacted with interacting_entity, the optional entity that is interacting with the block_state tool, the optional tool used to interact with block_state Fields that specify a target entity in a loot table, such as entity_properties.entity, can additionally target the target_entity and interacting_entity parameter types Added charged_creeper/root loot table for drops when an entity is killed by a Charged Creeper This loot table dispatches on the mob that was killed, to the following loot tables: charged_creeper/piglin charged_creeper/creeper charged_creeper/skeleton charged_creeper/wither_skeleton charged_creeper/zombie Once any mob killed drops an item from this loot table, other mobs killed by the same Creeper will not drop from this loot table Added brush/armadillo loot table for drops when an Armadillo is brushed Added gameplay/turtle_grow loot table for drops when a Turtle grows into an adult Added harvest/beehive loot table for drops when a Beehive or Bee Nest is harvested using Shears Added harvest/cave_vine loot table for drops when a Cave Vine with Glowberries is harvested by interacting with it Added carve/pumpkin loot table for drops when a Pumpkin is carved using Shears World Generation # The initial_density_without_jaggedness field in noise_settings definitions has been replaced with a preliminary_surface_level field initial_density_without_jaggedness was a 3D density function that was used to determine an approximate surface level by scanning for the first point with a density greater than 0.390625 preliminary_surface_level is a 2D density function that should produce the y-level of the approximate surface The minecraft:find_top_surface density function can be used to replicate the previous scanning Density Functions # Added minecraft:find_top_surface # Approximates the topmost surface of a given density function It scans from an upper bound to a lower bound to find the point at which the density changes from negative to positive The upper bound should be as close to the actual surface for best performance The upper bound should never be lower than the actual surface Fields:\ndensity -

These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future.

Some server properties have been moved to game rules, allowing them to be updated while the server is running. Additionally, player icons can now be used in chat, the copper golem has received some improvements and we are shipping a bunch of bug fixes.\nNew Features # Added Halychian language support Changes # Recipes # Hanging Signs can now only be crafted using Iron Chains UI # When adding a new server to the server list, the name is no longer prefilled. When left empty the default name is used. More text inputs now support selecting text by mouse dragging Mouse cursor # Some UI components will now change shape of mouse cursor Examples: text inputs, numeric sliders, buttons, scroll bars Additionally, clickable parts of text labels (like links) will now change cursor to the \u0026ldquo;hand\u0026rdquo;

New Blocks # Copper Chest # Has 4 oxidation variants and 2 waxed variants for each oxidation variant, like other copper-type blocks\nCan be crafted with the following recipe:\nThe oxidation and waxed variant of the chest when crafted is unoxidized and unwaxed, respectively The recipe is unlocked when obtaining a copper chest (of any variant) Is also generated below a copper golem spawned from a block of copper (any state) with a carved pumpkin on top\nThe oxidation variant of the chest corresponds to the oxidation variant of the block of copper used to generate it Copper Golem Statue # Has 4 oxidation variants and 2 waxed variants for each oxidation variant, like other copper-type blocks Its oxidized variant is placed into the world after a copper golem oxidizes past its oxidized state The statue will have a random pose when the block is generated When an axe is used on its non-oxidized variant, the block will be converted into a new copper golem mob If the copper golem initially used to generate the block had a custom name, the block will store that name and give it to the new copper golem spawned Interacting with the block will change the pose of the statue, cycling through a total of 4 different poses When connected to a redstone comparator, the comparator will produce a redstone signal, with the signal strength differing for each pose of the statue, from 1 to 4 When destroyed, its current pose is kept on the resulting item Is destroyed and dropped as an item when pushed by a piston Shelf # Has 12 variants corresponding to each wood type and to bamboo Oak\nSpruce\nBirch\nJungle\nAcacia\nDark Oak\nMangrove\nCherry\nPale Oak\nBamboo\nCrimson\nWarped\nCan be crafted with the following recipe:\nAll stripped logs, stripped stems, or blocks of stripped bamboo in the recipe have to be of the same type The type of shelf crafted corresponds to the type of stripped logs, stripped stems, or the blocks of stripped bamboo used to craft it The recipe for a specific type of shelf is unlocked when obtaining a stripped log, stripped stem, block of stripped bamboo, or a shelf, of the same wood type Can store up to 3 item stacks\nHas 3 slots that can each be interacted with, which will swap the contents of the slot with the item stack held in the player\u0026rsquo;s main hand\nIf a slot contains an item stack, the item will be displayed in front of the slot, similar to item frames\nWhen powered by a redstone signal, its slots will connect, making all of them interactable together\nWhen the player interacts with the block in this state, the contents of the player\u0026rsquo;s hotbar\u0026rsquo;s 3 rightmost item stacks will be swapped with the contents of the shelf\u0026rsquo;s slots When powered and adjacent to another shelf (regardless of its type) that is also powered, the shelves will connect together and combine their slots\nInteracting with any of the connected shelves will swap the same number of item stacks from the player\u0026rsquo;s hotbar as the number of shelf slots connected, starting from the rightmost slot of the hotbar Up to 3 powered shelves can be connected together, for a total of 9 connected slots, which will swap the contents of the player\u0026rsquo;s entire hotbar with the contents of all the shelves\u0026rsquo; slots When the block is destroyed, drops itself and the items stored inside it\nWhen connected to a redstone comparator, produces a redstone signal, with the signal strength depending on the which of its slots are filled\nThe signal strength is determined by converting the binary representation of its slots\u0026rsquo; filled state (from the first slot to the last slot) to a decimal value Examples: All slots empty (binary representation: 000) → signal strength of 0 First slot filled (binary representation: 001) → signal strength of 1 Second slot filled (binary representation: 010) → signal strength of 2 Third slot filled (binary representation: 100) → signal strength of 4 All slots filled (binary representation: 111) → signal strength of 7 Copper Torch # Does not oxidize over time, unlike other copper-type blocks\nCan be crafted with the following

used on a block, spawns a copper golem The oxidation and waxed variant of the mob is unoxidized and unwaxed, respectively New Mobs # Copper Golem # Has 4 oxidation variants and 2 waxed variants for each oxidation variant, like copper-type blocks Has the same oxidation and waxing functionality as copper-type blocks The mob\u0026rsquo;s oxidation variant or its waxed variant has no effect on its functionality As the mob gets more oxidized, the brightness of its eyes get dimmer (but the mob does not emit any light) After the mob oxidizes past its oxidized state, it will turn into an oxidized copper golem statue If the mob was holding items, it will drop them before turning into the statue Spawned from a block of copper (any state) with a carved pumpkin or jack o\u0026rsquo; lantern on top The oxidation variant of the mob corresponds to the oxidation variant of the block of copper used to spawn it A copper chest is also generated (of the same oxidation variant as the mob) below the mob Also spawned from using an axe on a non-oxidized copper golem statue Can pick up any items from nearby copper chests, if it is not holding items already Picks up a maximum of 16 of a single item stack at a time The chest will open when the mob is picking up items from it and close when the mob is done picking up items from it While holding items, interacting with the mob with an empty hand will make it drop the items If it is holding items, will look for a nearby chest (excluding copper chests) or trapped chest to put the items it is holding into The mob will only put items in the chest if the chest contains no items or contains the same item type as the items the mob has The mob will look for up to 10 chests in sequence to potentially put items into If no eligible chest is found, the mob will idle for 7 seconds before searching again The search area for chests from the mob\u0026rsquo;s position is 32 blocks horizontally and 8 blocks vertically If the chest is not on the same level as the mob, the mob can reach the chest up to 1 block vertically from it The chest will open when the mob is putting items into it and close when the mob is done putting items into it If a player is interacting with a chest that the mob is going to interact with, then the mob will queue in front of the chest until the player stops interacting with it When killed, drops 1-3 copper ingots and the items it is holding (if any) Its eyes are emissive (but do not actually emit gameplay-affecting light) When near an iron golem, there is a chance for the iron golem to offer a poppy to the mob and eventually plant the poppy on the mob\u0026rsquo;s head Can only occur during daytime Using shears on the mob will remove the poppy The poppy will be removed if the mob turns into a copper golem

the chance for the armor tier to be upgraded upon spawning to 10.87% from 9.5% (due to the addition of copper armor as a possibility) Technical Changelog # Additions # Minecraft Server Management Protocol # Is a server management API (JSON-RPC over WebSocket) for dedicated servers, adhering to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification Is disabled by default, but can be enabled using the new management-server-enabled server property The host and port the server is started on can be controlled by the new management-server-host and management-server-port server properties Can be accessed at ws://\u0026lt;management-server-host\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;management-server-port\u0026gt;, when enabled Clients must authenticate to access the API Clients should supply an Authorization bearer token header with a server-specific secret, which is configured through the new management-server-secret server property Unauthorized requests will be rejected with a 401 Unauthorized error Supports querying and updating of server state (players, allowlist, operators, settings, game rules) Sends notifications on state changes (e.g. player joins, game rule updates) Calling

The data generator will produce an API schema (in file json-rpc-api-schema.json) in the reports output folder, mirroring the contents returned by the rpc.discover API method Uses namespaced methods, with minecraft being a reserved namespace (e.g. minecraft:players, minecraft:allowlist/add, minecraft:notification:players/joined) Can be extended via custom namespaces for additional methods and events Contains the following core method groups: players, allowlist, operators, server (save, stop), server settings, game rules Errors and error codes follow the JSON-RPC 2.0 error object format The TLS protocol is enabled by default on the server, but can be configured through the new management-server-tls-enabled and management-server-tls-keystore server properties Example method call: Request:

that has any player activity, forceloaded chunks, active portals, or ender pearls in flight will now be considered \u0026ldquo;active\u0026rdquo; and keep processing chunks and entities Previously, this would only apply if a player was in the dimension or a chunk was forceloaded The concept of fixed \u0026ldquo;spawn chunks\u0026rdquo; no longer exists; the following chunks are now fully loaded before a player joins or the server starts: Forceloaded chunks, using the forceload command Chunks active due to portal activity Chunks containing an ender pearl belonging to an active player A small area of chunks around each player Chunks required to assign the global world spawn, on world creation only Updated the debug screen: Can now be accessed from anywhere in the game, instead of only while in a world Now displays less information by default Pressing F3+F6 now opens a new Debug Options screen, which can be used to configure which debug information should be displayed on the screen For each item, it can be set to one of the following options: Off – is never shown In F3 – visible only when the debug screen is opened Always – always visible, even when the debug screen is closed Items can be searched through A preset profile can also be selected, which automatically configures certain debug information to be shown, with the following available preset profiles: Default – resets everything to the default state Performance – shows simple performance metrics, with the FPS meter always visible on the screen Some debug features that were previously available, such as chunk border rendering or entity hitbox rendering, can now be configured to be shown through this screen Some debug features not previously available to end users, such as octree visualization, can now be configured to be shown through this screen The current state of the screen is now saved between game launches Improved entity rendering order for significantly better performance Updated pack versions: Now each support a minor version, which is incremented if the pack version is backwards-compatible with all pack versions with the same major version As a result, all packs that share the same major version will now be compatible with each other Updated the pack.mcmeta pack file, for data pack versions 82.0 and higher, and for resource pack versions 65.0 and higher: The pack.pack_format field is now optional The pack field and elements of the overlays.entries field now each have the following new fields: min_format – specifies the minimum supported pack version max_format – specifies the maximum supported pack version Types of each field: integer, integer\\[1\\] – specifies a major pack version; the minor pack version is assumed to be 0 integer\\[2\\] – specifies a major and minor pack version Removed the following fields: pack.supported_formats, overlays.entries[].formats The display field of a model now accepts the key on_shelf, which controls the display of the model when its corresponding item is placed on a shelf The vertical translation specified will be ignored if the align_items_to_bottom field of the shelf\u0026rsquo;s block entity is set to false Particles outside the player\u0026rsquo;s view are no longer rendered, which can provide a performance improvement in some cases Some debug features that were previously removed during compilation are now preserved and can be used by users Individual values can be enabled with JVM properties First, a global debug flag must be enabled with -DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED or -DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED=true Then, a specific debug feature can be enabled, for example: -DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN or -DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN=true To get a full list of all available debug properties, add -DMC_DEBUG_PRINT_PROPERTIES Is an advanced feature and is not guaranteed to function properly Test instance blocks now preserve error markers between world reloads Removed the following server properties: allow-nether, spawn-monsters, enable-command-block, pvp Each removed property has been replaced with a corresponding new game rule 163 Bug Fixes # MC-383 - In the world selection screen,

Age","type":"changelog"},{"content":" News A new week, and a new snapshot. This one includes another big batch of bug fixes, copper golem polishing and our beloved friend can now open doors. Happy mining!\u0026quot;\nSliced Lime Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu1O2wH0BCg Changes # OpenGL 3.3 is now required to play the game, up from 3.2. This does not change our posted Minimum Requirements Developer's Note: We do not expect the update to OpenGL version to affect many people, if any at all. Our posted Minimum Requirements has been OpenGL 4.0 since 2017, and OpenGL 3.3 turned 15 years old recently. Minor Tweaks to Blocks, Items and Entities\nFixed a bug where breaking a Shelf while another player is interacting with it could lead to visual bugs in the player inventory\nCopper Golems hitbox has been tweakedThe hitbox is now 0.49 blocks in width to be able to pathfind through narrow spaces\nCopper Golems can now open doors\nTest Instance Blocks now preserve error markers between world reloads\nAmbient lighting on entities has been adjusted to be more visually in line with blocks and other parts of the gameThe underside of flat surfaces will now be lit from that direction, instead of the opposite direction This mainly affects models containing cubes that are either flat or \u0026ldquo;hollow\u0026rdquo; such as:\nWorn armor Worn Elytra The outside layers on player skins The ribcages of Skeletons or Skeleton Horses The feet of Chickens or Frogs The wings of Phantoms or the Ender Dragon The fins on fish And more! Game Mode Switching # Switching from Spectator Mode to Creative Mode no longer causes the player to stop flying Instead, flight now only gets disabled when switching game modes if the player is near the ground A player is considered to be near the ground if there is a collidable surface (i.e. blocks, Happy Ghasts, boats\u0026hellip;) within 1 block below them Flight will not get disabled if the player was inside a block or collidable entity This is to prevent players from suddenly falling through the ground Developer's Note: This change is a partial revert of a bugfix from a previous snapshot. Even though the old behavior prior to the fix was unintended, the approach we took to fixing flight didn't quite land the way we wanted it to. In response to community feedback, we're trying this new approach as a less disruptive alternative.

Technical Changes # Die Data Pack version ist nun 77 Die Resource Pack version ist nun 61 \u0026ldquo;Command Syntax\u0026rdquo; report now contains information about required permission level Data Pack Version 77 # Neue optionale Felder \u0026ldquo;can_be_sheared\u0026rdquo; und \u0026ldquo;shearing_sound\u0026rdquo; wurden zum equippable item component hinzugefügt Es wurde eine Möglichkeit hinzugefügt, sehr einfache Dialoge für Benutzer anzuzeigen Added custom - ein neuer click_event action type für text components Benutzer werden nun zur Bestätigung aufgefordert, bevor sie einen Befehl aus der run_command-Klickaktion in Büchern und im Chat ausführen, wenn der Befehl nicht geparst werden kann oder erhöhte Berechtigungen erfordert (d.h. höher als 0) Dialogs # Ein Paar Beispiele des neuen Dialogs systems:\nKeine Zeit mehr den rest zu übersetzen ist aber auch nicht so wichtig ich denke die videos sagen schon alles\nAdded a way to display simple modal dialogs to a user Dialogs are stored in a minecraft:dialog registry, but can also be defined inline Dialogs are an experimental feature To avoid user confusion, dialog screens are marked with a warning sign next to the title Clicking on this warning leads to a dialog that explains to user that this screen is provided by custom content It also gives user an option to leave current world to avoid them being locked in infinite loop of dialogs Dialogs can be displayed by server in play and configuration connection phases However, only inline registries are allowed in configuration, since registries are not yet available in that phase Dialogs always close after user selects any action Dialogs by default will also close after Escape key is pressed When this happens, dialog will run action specific to dialog type described as \u0026ldquo;exit action\u0026rdquo; below This behavior is configurable When dialog screen is closed, game goes back to previously displayed non-dialog screen or back to gameplay That means that new dialogs always replace already opened ones, if any Dialogs screens will pause the game in singleplayer mode Dialogs can be configured to be accessible from Pause menu This replaces and expands \u0026ldquo;Server Links\u0026rdquo; button added in previous versions Most dialogs follow a common layout, however exact contents depend on type: Header with title and warning button Body elements (labels, inputs, buttons and submit actions), scrollable if needed Optional footer, contains main buttons and submit actions Developer\u0026rsquo;s Note: Dialogs are not supposed to fully describe any in-game UI, but just to allow custom content to display simple messages and get input from users.
