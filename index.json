[{"content":" News Slicedlime Videos: Normal / Technical\nSnapshot Datapack: Download\nIt\u0026rsquo;s Snapshot Tues- I mean Thursday, everyone! Today, we are kicking off a brand-new Snapshot series and with it comes the first set of features from our upcoming game drop, Mounts of Mayhem! Charge into the fray with the spear, a new weapon with a unique enchantment. Explore the oceans atop your nautilus or claim undead mounts – the zombie horse and zombie nautilus – as your new steeds. Galloping side to side with these new features is both a revamped video settings screen that includes nifty new graphical presets, as well as the new stopwatch command which keeps track of real time. Bug fixes and technical changes round off the meal, as is tradition.\nHappy mining!\nNew Features # Added Nautilus and Zombie Nautilus Added Nautilus Armor Added Spear Weapon Updated advancements to include Nautilus, Zombie Nautilus, and the Zombie Horse Nautilus # Nautilus Baby Nautilus Nautilus is a new neutral aquatic mob Spawns in all ocean biomes Attacks using a Dash attack, if provoked Occasionally attacks Pufferfish within range using the Dash attack Has a Dash skill similar to Camels, used by pressing the Jump button Takes suffocation damage on land Adds the \u0026ldquo;Breath of the Nautilus\u0026rdquo; effect to mounted players Nautilus can be bred and tamed using Pufferfish or a Bucket of Pufferfish A Tamed Nautilus: Can be mounted using a Saddle With a Saddle has a roaming restriction of 16 blocks Without a Saddle has a roaming restriction of 32 blocks Zombie Nautilus # Zombie Nautilus is a new underwater mob that spawns with a Drowned rider wielding a Trident Zombie Nautilus is only hostile if ridden by a hostile mob Zombie Nautilus behaves similar to the Nautilus except that it cannot be bred Nautilus Armor # Equippable on the Nautilus and Zombie Nautilus Comes in Copper, Golden, Iron, Diamond and Netherite versions Item: Model: Spear Weapon # Wood\nStone\nCopper\nIron\nGold\nDiamond\nNetherite\nNew weapon that can be crafted in Wood, Stone, Copper, Iron, Gold, Diamond and Netherite versions\nEach material has different stats for timing, influencing how fast they are to use\nHas a minimum reach for damage, being too close to a target will yield no damage\nHas extended maximum reach compared to other tools and weapons\nHas two attacks. Jab and Charge\nZombies, Husks, Zombified Piglins and Piglins can spawn with the Spear\nJab Attack # Quick-press primary action button to use Low damage attack with knockback Cooldown between attacks Wooden Spears have the fastest cooldown; Netherite the slowest Can hit multiple enemies Does not destroy blocks Charge Attack # Press and hold the secondary action button to use Damage is based on Spear material, the player’s view angle, and the velocity of both the player and the target While holding down the button, the attack goes through three stages before returning to idle: Engaged: The Spear can deal damage, knockback, and dismount mounted enemies if the speed is above the required thresholds Tired: Indicated by the Spear rotating to a vertical position and shaking. The Spear can deal damage and knockback (but not dismount) if the speed is above the required thresholds Disengaged: Indicated by the Spear being lowered, pointing downwards. The Spear gives damage but not knockback or dismount if the speed is above the required threshold The Spear\u0026rsquo;s range when used by mobs is half of that when used by players, but they can deal damage, dismount and knockback at lower speeds than the players Zombies, Husks and Zombified Piglins know how to charge with a Spear Lunge Enchantment # Spear exclusive enchantment Only works with the Jab attack When doing a Jab attack with Lunge, it propels the player horizontally in the view direction The view angle needs to be perfectly leveled horizontally to achieve maximum lunge distance Does significant durability damage to the Spear lvl 1: 8 dmg lvl 2: 32 dmg lvl 3: 128 dmg Unbreaking reduces the dura dmg from the Enchant Mobs können das Enchant auch benutzen: /summon silverfish ~ ~ ~ {equipment:{mainhand:{id:\"iron_spear\",count:1,components:{\"minecraft:unbreakable\":{},\"minecraft:enchantments\":{\"lunge\":5}}}}} Advancements # Updated the \u0026ldquo;How did we get here?\u0026rdquo; advancement to include the Breath of the Nautilus effect Updated the \u0026ldquo;Best Friends Forever\u0026rdquo; advancement to include the Nautilus, Zombie Nautilus, and the Zombie Horse Updated the \u0026ldquo;The Parrots and the Bats\u0026rdquo; advancement to include the Nautilus Updated the \u0026ldquo;Two by Two\u0026rdquo; advancement to include the Nautilus Updated the \u0026ldquo;Monster Hunter\u0026rdquo; advancement to include the Zombie Nautilus Updated the \u0026ldquo;A Throwaway Joke\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Take Aim\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;It Spreads\u0026rdquo; advancements to include the Nautilus and Zombie Nautilus Changes # Zombies, Husks, Piglins and Zombified Piglins can now hold Spears\nPiglins now consider Golden Spears as one of the items they like\nItems will no longer \u0026ldquo;bob\u0026rdquo; whenever their durability changes, such as when losing durability from an attack, or repaired by Mending\nSome changes were made to debug renderers\nGraphics modes \u0026ldquo;Fast\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Fancy\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Fabulous!\u0026rdquo; have been replaced with graphics presets with the same names\nCloud movement is now the same for all players on a server\nNetherite Armor points have been increased for the Body slot from 11 to 19 (Body ist der Slot für Horse, Nautilus und Wolf Armor etc)\nAll blocks in the world now have mipmaps applied if enabled in video settings\nBlocks that did not have mipmaps before, such as different vines, rails, folliage (apart from leaves) and more should look better from higher distances Client FPS is expected to be higher for most players\nHermitcraft 10 Map / 32 Chunks: 1.21.10 25w41a Zombie Horse # Zombie Horses now spawn naturally Zombie Horses spawn in darkness, and burn in sunlight like other undead mobs Zombie Horses count towards the hostile mob cap and spawn with other hostile mobs Zombie Horses do not display any hostile behavior towards players.

Performance\u0026rdquo; settings at once, not only the ones that were previously hidden behind the \u0026ldquo;Graphics\u0026rdquo; setting Available presets are \u0026ldquo;Fast\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Fancy\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Fabulous!\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Custom\u0026rdquo; The default preset is \u0026ldquo;Fancy\u0026rdquo; for new players But for players who are upgrading to this version the preset will be set to \u0026ldquo;Custom\u0026rdquo; to preserve your current configuration UI # Menu sliders will now \u0026ldquo;stick\u0026rdquo; to the closest available value when you release them after dragging with a mouse When using keyboard to change slider values, arrow keys will now move the slider to the next available value, not by one pixel as before The inF3 button in the Debug Option screen has been renamed to inOverlay Technical Changes # The Data Pack version is now 89.0 The Resource Pack version is now 70.0 The Minecraft Server Management Protocol version is now 1.1.0 Added ClientFps JFR event Experience packets that do not change the player\u0026rsquo;s experience progress or level are no longer sent by the server Minecraft Server Management Protocol Version 1.1.0 # Added a new notification server/activity Indicates that a network connection to the server has been initiated Rate limited to 1 notification per 30 seconds Data Pack Version 89.0 # Added stopwatch command for keeping track of real time Commands # Added stopwatch # New command that allows the creation of a Stopwatch that keeps track of real time Stopwatches do not depend on game ticks They only run when the server/world is running, even when paused Syntax:\nstopwatch \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; create - creates a Stopwatch with the given namespaced ID /stopwatch cc create stopwatch \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; query - shows the elapsed time in seconds of the given Stopwatch in chat /stopwatch cc query stopwatch \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; restart - restarts the given Stopwatch /stopwatch cc restart stopwatch \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; remove - removes the given Stopwatch /stopwatch cc remove Developer's Note: This command is added to replace the need of using world borders to keep track of real time. The intent is to change the world border to be dependent on game ticks in a future snapshot. If you've relied on this way of measuring the passage of real time before, please switch to using the new command and let us know if anything doesn't work as intended. Thank you! execute # Added new syntax /execute if|unless stopwatch \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;range\u0026gt;\nAllows to compare the elapsed time of a given Stopwatch with a floating point value range\nThe Stopwatch value is measured in seconds and has an accuracy of at most a millisecond Example: /execute if stopwatch foo:bar ..10 run say Stopwatch foo:bar has not reached 10 seconds yet /stopwatch cc restart /execute if stopwatch cc ..3 run say hi Item Components # Added minecraft:use_effects # Controls how the player behaves when using an item (right mouse click)\nFormat: object with fields\ncan_sprint: boolean, whether the player can sprint while using this item Default value: false speed_multiplier: float (0 to 1), the speed multiplier applied to the player while using this item Default value: 0.2 e.g. use_effects={can_sprint:true,speed_multiplier:1.0} Beispiele # Consumable, das einem nicht erlaubt, sich zu bewegen, solange man es konsumiert: /give @p weathered_copper_golem_statue[consumable={consume_seconds:1},food={nutrition:2,saturation:2,can_always_eat:true},use_effects={sprinting:false,speed_multiplier:0},minecraft:max_stack_size=99] 99 Consumable, bei dem man sich ganz normal bewegen kann, während man es konsumiert: /give @p weathered_copper_golem_statue[consumable={consume_seconds:1},food={nutrition:2,saturation:2,can_always_eat:true},use_effects={sprinting:true,speed_multiplier:1.0},minecraft:max_stack_size=99] 99 Huge für Datapacks, weil man vorher mit Items mit dem Consumable Component für RClick detection verlangsamt wurde. bsp:\n(Benötigt das Snasphot Datapack!)\nold: /give @p stick[consumable={consume_seconds:999999999,animation:\"none\",has_consume_particles:false}] new: /give @p stick[consumable={consume_seconds:999999999,animation:\"none\",has_consume_particles:false,use_effects={sprinting:true,speed_multiplier:1.0}}] Added minecraft:minimum_attack_charge # Sets the minimum attack charge on the attack indicator required to attack with this item Format: float (0.0 to 1.0) 0.0: no charge required 1.0: full charge required Added minecraft:damage_type # Specifies the type of damage this item deals\nFormat: string, damage type identifier\ne.g. damage_type='minecraft:spear' /give @s minecraft:netherite_sword[minecraft:damage_type=\"minecraft:freeze\"] ↓ /item replace entity @n[type=minecraft:husk] weapon from entity @s weapon.mainhand ↓ Get Killed by the Husk -\u0026gt; Notice Death Message Added minecraft:kinetic_weapon # (der spear fast komplett datadriven 🎉 Danke Mojang)\nEnables a charge-type attack when using the item (primarily for Spears), where, while being used, the damage is dealt along a ray every tick based on the relative speed of the entities\nFormat: object with fields\nmin_reach: float, the minimum distance in blocks from the attacker to the target to be considered valid Default value: 0.0 max_reach: float, the maximum distance in blocks from the attacker to the target to be considered valid Default value: 3.0 hitbox_margin: float, the margin applied to the target bounding box when checking for valid hitbox collision Default value: 0.3 delay_ticks: integer, the time in ticks required before weapon is effective Default value: 0 dismount_conditions, knockback_conditions, damage_conditions: indicating the condition to apply dismount, knockback and damage effects respectively.

Happy International Translation day! Copper Chest # The Copper Chest is a new type of chest that has waxed and oxidized variants\nCopper Chests oxidize over time and can be waxed like other Copper blocks\nA Copper Chest can be crafted using a Chest and 8 Copper Ingots\nCopper Golem # The Copper Golem is a new mob which can be spawned by placing a Jack o\u0026rsquo;Lantern or Carved Pumpkin on top of a Copper block Copper Golems oxidize over time and can be waxed like Copper blocks If the Copper Golem is fully oxidized and not waxed it will turn into a Copper Golem Statue Upon turning into a statue, the Copper Golem will drop any item it may be holding The statue retains the Copper Golem\u0026rsquo;s name Copper Golems can help with sorting items into Chests Interacting with the Copper Golem with an empty hand will make it drop its carried item Iron Golems will occasionally plant a decorative flower onto a nearby Copper Golem The flower can be removed with Shears This flower is dropped when the Copper Golem turns into a Copper Golem Statue A trio of Copper Golems hanging out in a Taiga Village. Click to see full image Copper Golem Item Sorting # If the Copper Golem is not holding an item, it will look for nearby Copper Chests to try to pick up an item The Copper Golem will look in any oxidized and waxed Copper Chest variant to pick up items It can pick up at most 16 items in a stack at a time Any item in a Copper Chest can be picked up If the Copper Golem is holding an item, it will look for nearby Chests to try to place the item in The Copper Golem will look in Chests and Trapped Chests to try to place items It can place an item in a Chest if it\u0026rsquo;s empty, or if it contains the same type of item that it is holding in its hand The Copper Golem will visit at most 10 Chests or Copper Chests in sequence to try to pick up or place an item If no matching chest is found the Copper Golem will idle for 7 seconds before trying again The search area for chests from the Copper Golem\u0026rsquo;s position is horizontally 32 blocks and vertically 8 blocks Three Copper Golems are crossing a bridge built out of copper. Two of the golems are transporting items. Click to see full image Copper Golem Statue Block # A Copper Statue, doing its signature \"star\" pose, can be seen on top of a copper pedestal. Click to see full image The Copper Golem Statue is a new type of decorative block which has waxed and oxidized variants The Copper Golem Statue oxidizes over time and can be waxed like Copper blocks If the Copper Golem Statue has no oxidation when interacted with using an Axe, the statue will turn into a Copper Golem The Copper Golem Statue can be in one out of four poses: standing, sitting, running, and star The pose of the statue can be changed by interacting with it Each pose emits a Redstone Comparator signal A house made out of various Copper blocks, with some Copper Golem Statues in various poses Click to see full image Copper Equipment # Added Copper Nugget Added Copper armor Added Copper Helmet , Copper Chestplate , Copper Leggings and Copper Boots Copper armor has higher durability than Leather and Gold Copper armor has slightly less enchantability than Iron Added Copper tools and weapons\nAdded Copper Axe , Copper Hoe , Copper Pickaxe , Copper Shovel and Copper Sword Copper tools and weapons do the same amount of damage as Stone, but have higher durability Copper tools work faster and last longer than Stone Copper tools have higher enchantability than Diamond, but slightly less than Iron Copper equipment can be crafted using Copper Ingots Copper equipment can be repaired with Copper Ingots Copper equipment turns into a Copper Nugget when smelted Added Copper Horse Armor Has the same loot table and chance of generating as Iron Horse Armor Armor toughness: 4 Two horses, wearing Copper Horse Armor, can be seen tied to fence posts in a Village.

Click to see full image Minecraft Server Management Protocol # Added a server management API (JSON-RPC over WebSocket) for dedicated servers\nThe API is disabled by default and can be enabled in server.properties management-server-enabled=true management-server-host=localhost management-server-port=0 The API is accessible at ws://\u0026lt;management-server-host\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;management-server-port\u0026gt; when enabled Supports querying and updating of server state (players, allowlist, operators, settings, game rules) Sends notifications on state changes (e.g. player joins, game rule updates) Calling {\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:1,\u0026quot;method\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;rpc.discover\u0026quot;} returns an API schema containing supported methods and notifications of the currently running server The Data Generator produces an API schema (json-rpc-api-schema.json) in the reports output folder mirroring the contents returned by the rpc.discover method The API adheres to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification Uses namespaced methods and the reserved namespaces are minecraft (e.g. minecraft:players, minecraft:allowlist/add) Extensible via custom namespaces for additional methods and events Core method groups: players, allowlist, operators, server (save, stop), server settings, game rules Example method call: Request: {\u0026quot;method\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;minecraft:allowlist/add\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:1,\u0026quot;params\u0026quot;:[[{\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;jeb_\u0026quot;}]]} Response: {\u0026quot;jsonrpc\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;2.0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:1,\u0026quot;result\u0026quot;:[{\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;853c80ef-3c37-49fd-aa49-938b674adae6\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;jeb_\u0026quot;}]} Example notification: {\u0026quot;jsonrpc\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;2.0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;method\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;minecraft:notification/players/joined\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;params\u0026quot;:[{\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;853c80ef-3c37-49fd-aa49-938b674adae6\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;jeb_\u0026quot;}]} Example error: Request: {\u0026quot;method\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;minecraft:foo/bar\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: 1} Response: {\u0026quot;jsonrpc\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;2.0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:1,\u0026quot;result\u0026quot;:{\u0026quot;jsonrpc\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;2.0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:1,\u0026quot;error\u0026quot;:{\u0026quot;code\u0026quot;:-32601,\u0026quot;message\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Method not found\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Method not found: minecraft:foo/bar\u0026quot;}}} Errors and error codes follow JSON-RPC 2.0 error object format Clients must authenticate to access the API Clients should supply an Authorization bearer token header with a server-specific secret The secret is configured in server.properties management-server-secret= The secret should be exactly 40 alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) The secret will be automatically generated if the server property is empty Unauthorized requests are rejected with 401 Unauthorized TLS is enabled by default Can be disabled in server.properties management-server-tls-enabled=false Requires a keystore file to be set in server.properties management-server-tls-keystore=path/to/keystore.p12 The keystore file must be in PKCS12 format Keystore password can be set in the following ways, in order of priority Environment variable: MINECRAFT_MANAGEMENT_TLS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD JVM argument: -Dmanagement.tls.keystore.password= Server property: management-server-tls-keystore-password= Chat Drafts # Unsent chat messages now get saved as Chat Drafts if the chat was forcibly closed This includes it being closed by external sources such as dying or a dialog opening, but not the player intentionally closing their chat Any existing Chat Draft will get pre-filled into the message box the next time the chat is opened Draft text has a grayed-out appearance until fully restored Draft text can be restored as regular text by interacting with it: Typing additional text Moving the text cursor using the arrow keys Clicking it Highlighting it Pressing enter on a Chat Draft prior to it being restored sends it like a normal chat message Pressing backspace on a Chat Draft prior to it being restored deletes it Added an option to the Chat Settings screen that enables saving unsent chat messages by default With this option enabled, unsent messages will always get saved as Chat Drafts, even if the player intentionally closed their chat Server Code of Conduct # When connecting to a server, a Code of Conduct screen can now be shown.\nAccepting the Code of Conduct is required to play on the server A checkbox is available for not showing the same Code of Conduct in the future If the Code of Conduct changes, it will be shown again Server Setup # A new boolean field has been added to server.properties called enable-code-of-conduct Setting it to true will make the server look for Code of Conduct files in the codeofconduct subfolder in the same folder as server.properties Each file in the folder should have the form \u0026lt;language_code\u0026gt;.txt and be UTF-8 encoded The language shown will attempt to match the player\u0026rsquo;s language If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, the en_us Code of Conduct will be used If that also doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, an arbitrary available entry is used Sounds # Some sound sliders in the Music \u0026amp; Sound Options now play a preview sound when adjusting the setting outside a world Accessibility # The \u0026ldquo;Attack/Destroy\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Use Item/Place Block\u0026rdquo; key binds are now toggleable, meaning they can be set to either \u0026ldquo;Hold\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Toggle\u0026rdquo; in the Controls screen Added \u0026ldquo;Invert Mouse X\u0026rdquo; option to the Mouse Settings screen, which inverts the mouse x-axis Added \u0026ldquo;Sprint Window\u0026rdquo; option to the Controls screen, which represents the time window in ticks where double-tapping the forward key activates sprint Multiple key binds that have the same key assigned to them can now work together, while before only one would work For example, you can now bind D to Jump and Strafe Left to jump and strafe left at the same time The red warning for assigning the same key to multiple key binds is changed to yellow The spectator hotbar menu key can now be rebound It is part of a new Spectator category in the Key Binds screen, alongside the pre-existing Highlight Players key bind Changes # Performance improvements The Chain block has been renamed to \u0026ldquo;Iron Chain\u0026rdquo; Monster Spawn Eggs now have a tooltip warning when the difficulty is set to Peaceful The mob no longer spawns for one tick when an attempt is made to use the Spawn Egg Changes to world loading and the \u0026ldquo;Spawn Chunks\u0026rdquo; A dimension that has any player activity, forceloaded chunks, active portals, or Ender Pearls in flight will be considered \u0026ldquo;active\u0026rdquo; and will keep processing chunks and entities Previously, this would only apply if a player was in the dimension or a chunk was forceloaded Reworked the debug overlay to be less cluttered and more configurable Players seen in the game world of the current server are now always shown in the Social Interactions screen even if they are offline Players now stop flying when switching from Spectator Mode to Creative Mode if they are near the ground A player is considered to be near the ground if there is a collidable surface (i.e. blocks, Happy Ghasts, boats\u0026hellip;) within 1 block below them Flight will not get disabled if the player was inside a block or collidable entity This is to prevent players from suddenly falling through the ground Migrated several server properties into game rules OpenGL 3.3 is now required to play the game, up from 3.2. This does not change our posted Minimum Requirements Developer's Note: We do not expect the update to OpenGL version to affect many people, if any at all. Our posted Minimum Requirement has been OpenGL 4.0 since 2017, and OpenGL 3.3 turned 15 years old recently. Performance Improvements # Entity rendering order was improved for significantly better performance You’ll notice much smoother gameplay in areas with lots of mobs, like mob farms FPS won’t improve much if most of your lag comes from things other than entities, like playing with high render distance while not being near many mobs Particles outside the player\u0026rsquo;s view are not rendered anymore, which provides a performance improvement in some cases World Loading and Spawn Chunks # The concept of fixed \u0026ldquo;Spawn Chunks\u0026rdquo; has been removed The game will ensure that the following chunks are fully loaded before the player joins or the server starts, in the same way as spawn chunks formerly were: Chunks loaded by the forceload command Chunks active due to portal activity Thrown Ender Pearls (Singleplayer only) A small area of chunks around the player (Singleplayer only) Chunks required to assign the global world spawn (World creation only) The world loading screen now shows the chunks that the player is about to be placed into, rather than chunks loaded around world spawn The loading screen now has a progress bar This progress bar accounts for all kinds of chunk loading mentioned above Developer's Note: Spawn chunks incur a memory and performance cost for all players and have outlived their initial technical purpose of keeping the spawn area ready for players to quickly join into. However, we also want to recognize that spawn chunks have enabled a multitude of clever contraptions and farms throughout the years, so simply removing them without having other mechanics in the game enable these designs was never an option.\nWe believe that the niche held by spawn chunks has now been filled by alternative methods of chunk loading, such as using portals or ender pearls, particularly with the changes in this snapshot to how the game loads these chunks before the world starts ticking.\nServer Properties # Several server properties were removed in favor of making them into game rules, allowing these settings to be changed while the server is running.\nRemoved server property allow-nether in favor of the new game rule allowEnteringNetherUsingPortals Removed server property spawn-monsters in favor of the new game rule spawnMonsters Removed server property enable-command-block in favor of the new game rule commandBlocksEnabled Removed server property pvp in favor of the new game rule pvp Added server property management-server-enabled controlling whether the new Minecraft Server Management Protocol is enabled or not Defaults to false Added server property management-server-port controlling on what port the Minecraft Server Management Protocol is started Defaults to 0, assigning an available port each time management server is started Added server property management-server-host controlling with what host the new Minecraft Server Management Protocol is started Defaults to localhost Added server property management-server-tls-enabled controlling whether the Minecraft Server Management Protocol uses TLS or not Defaults to true Added server property management-server-tls-keystore controlling the path to the keystore file used for TLS Defaults to an empty string A dedicated server won\u0026rsquo;t start when TLS is enabled and no keystore is provided Added server property management-server-tls-keystore-password controlling the password to the keystore file used for TLS Defaults to an empty string Added server property status-heartbeat-interval controlling the interval the management server sends heartbeat notifications to connected clients Defaults to 0, meaning it’s disabled Added server property enable-code-of-conduct Details on this property can be found in the \u0026ldquo;Server Setup\u0026rdquo; header Game Rules # Removed spawnChunkRadius game rule\nAdded pvp game rule controlling whether players can deal damage to other players\nDefaults to true /gamerule pvp false Added allowEnteringNetherUsingPortals game rule controlling if the Nether can be entered through portals\nDefaults to true /gamerule allowEnteringNetherUsingPortals false Added spawnMonsters game rule controlling if monsters should spawn naturally\nDefaults to true /gamerule spawnMonsters false Added commandBlocksEnabled game rule controlling if Command Blocks should be enabled or not\nDefaults to true /gamerule commandBlocksEnabled false Added spawnerBlocksEnabled game rule controlling if Spawner Blocks should be enabled or not\nDefaults to true /gamerule spawnerBlocksEnabled false Mob Spawning # The logic for choosing a type of equipment for mobs spawning with equipment has been tweaked to add Copper as a possibility The initial roll to choose a type now chooses between Leather, Copper and Gold The chance to increase an armor tier has increased from 9.5% to 10.87% Minor Tweaks to Blocks, Items and Entities # Test Instance Blocks now preserve error markers between world reloads Ambient lighting on entities has been adjusted to be more visually in line with blocks and other parts of the game The underside of flat surfaces will now be lit from that direction, instead of the opposite direction This mainly affects models containing cubes that are either flat or \u0026ldquo;hollow\u0026rdquo; such as: Worn armor Worn Elytra The outside layers on player skins The ribcages of Skeletons or Skeleton Horses The feet of Chickens or Frogs The wings of Phantoms or the Ender Dragon The fins on fish And more! Recipes # Changed the Copper Trapdoor recipe to use 4 Copper Ingots instead of 6 and now yields one Copper Trapdoor instead of two Sounds # The Happy Ghast is now audible from 64 blocks Sounds for Chests now play at a lower volume The volume at which a sound is played at now respects the sound source volume value The \u0026ldquo;Voice/Speech\u0026rdquo; sound source has been rephrased to \u0026ldquo;Narrator/Voice\u0026rdquo; UI # The Resource Pack and Data Pack selection screens now have a search box More text inputs now support selecting text by mouse dragging Double-clicking a word in an edit box now selects it When adding a new server to the server list, the server name is no longer prefilled When omitted, the default name \u0026ldquo;Minecraft Server\u0026rdquo; is used Mouse cursor # Some UI components will now change the shape of the mouse cursor Examples: text inputs, numeric sliders, buttons, scroll bars Additionally, clickable parts of text labels (like links) will now change the cursor to the \u0026ldquo;hand\u0026rdquo; shape This feature can be disabled with the \u0026ldquo;Allow Cursor Changes\u0026rdquo; option in the Mouse Settings screen Debug Overlay # The debug overlay is accessible by pressing F3, as before The debug overlay can now be accessed from everywhere in the game, not only when in a game world It is now less cluttered, displaying less information by default Added a new Debug Options screen, available by pressing F3 + F6, which can be used to configure what debug information should be displayed For each element, you can configure whether it should be visible in the debug overlay or not, and can even set it to always be visible regardless of the debug overlay being active Some debug features that were previously available, like chunk border rendering or entity hitbox rendering, can now be toggled through this Debug Options screen Some debug features that were not previously available to the community, like Octree visualization, are now accessible through the Debug Options screen The state of the Debug Options screen is saved between launches of the game The Debug Options screen has the following preset profiles: Default resets everything to the default state Performance shows simple performance metrics, including the FPS meter always visible Developer's Note: Previously, gathering the information every frame to render the F3 screen had a significant performance cost. So opening the screen to check your FPS noticeably dropped the FPS. Now checking your FPS in the`Performance` profile should not affect game performance. Chat # It is now possible to start chatting while standing inside a Nether Portal The chat will now remain open and unchanged if the player was chatting before being transferred to another dimension Accessibility # Dye Colors now have updated icons The goal with these is to enhance visual cohesion across the dye set while maintaining distinct shapes to support colorblind accessibility New Old A button leading to the Controls screen has been added to the Accessibility Settings screen The \u0026ldquo;Auto-Jump\u0026rdquo; option, as well as the \u0026ldquo;Sneak\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Sprint\u0026rdquo; toggles have been removed from the Accessibility Settings screen The \u0026ldquo;Show Subtitles\u0026rdquo; option has been rephrased to \u0026ldquo;Closed Captions\u0026rdquo; to more accurately describe what it does The \u0026ldquo;Hide Lightning Flashes\u0026rdquo; accessibility setting has been renamed to \u0026ldquo;Hide Sky Flashes\u0026rdquo; as it includes the End light flashes Technical Changes # Pack versions now have minor versions The Data Pack version is now 88.0 The Resource Pack version is now 69.0 Some previously hidden debug features have been exposed to players Pack Formats # The pack versions for data packs and resource packs now have minor versions A minor version increment of the game\u0026rsquo;s pack version is backwards-compatible, meaning all packs made for previous iterations of the same major version will keep working Packs can set compatibility requirements on minor versions in case they rely on resources introduced in a minor version Pack Metadata # The pack.mcmeta format has been updated:\nThe supported_formats field has been removed If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed The pack_format field is now optional If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required Added required field min_format - specifies the minimum version supported A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g. [74, 1] Specifying a single integer is interpreted as that major version, e.g. 74 is the same thing as [74, 0] Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone Added required field max_format - specifies the maximum version supported A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g. [74, 1] Specifying a single integer is interpreted as any minor version, i.e. the minor version is 0x7fffffff Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone For overlay entries: The formats field has been removed If your pack includes any overlay range that includes a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required for all overlay definitions Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed Added required fields min_format and max_format with the same formats as the fields above with the same name for the pack section Example:\n{ \u0026#34;pack\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;new pack.mcmeta example\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;min_format\u0026#34;: 69, \u0026#34;max_format\u0026#34;: 99 } } Debug Features # Some debug features that were previously removed during compilation are now preserved and can be used by players Individual values can be enabled with JVM properties: First, a global debug flag must be enabled with -DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED or -DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED=true Then, a specific feature can be enabled, for example -DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN or -DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN=true To get the list of all available debug properties, add -DMC_DEBUG_PRINT_PROPERTIES Warning: this is debug code, and the primary intention is to help modders - not for normal play.

Optional namespaced ID of the skin texture to use for rendering The skin is specified relative to the textures folder and with a .png suffix e.g. entity/player/wide/steve will use the default wide Steve skin cape - Optional namespaced ID of the cape texture to use for rendering When specified, uses the same format as the texture field elytra - Optional namespaced ID of the elytra texture to use for rendering When specified, uses the same format as the texture field If this value is not present either as an override or in a player profile, Mannequins using this profile will use the cape texture, or if that is also not present, the default Elytra texture when wearing an Elytra model -

These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future.

when placed next to each other, up to 3 powered Shelves will connect\nInteracting with a single powered Shelf swaps all its contents with the 3 rightmost items in the player\u0026rsquo;s hotbar Interacting with two connected Shelves swaps their contents with the 6 rightmost items in the player\u0026rsquo;s hotbar Interacting with three connected Shelves swaps their contents with all items in the player\u0026rsquo;s hotbar It does not matter which of the connected Shelves the player interacts with Accessibility # The \u0026ldquo;Attack/Destroy\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Use Item/Place Block\u0026rdquo; keybinds are now toggleable, meaning they can be set to either \u0026ldquo;Hold\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Toggle\u0026rdquo; in the Controls screen Added \u0026ldquo;Invert Mouse X\u0026rdquo; option to the Mouse Settings screen, which inverts the mouse x-axis Added \u0026ldquo;Sprint Window\u0026rdquo; option to the Controls screen, which represents the time window in ticks where double-tapping the forward key activates sprint Changes # Monster Spawn Eggs now have a tooltip warning when the difficulty is set to Peaceful The mob no longer spawns for one tick when an attempt is made to use the Spawn Egg The debug screen was reworked to be less cluttered and more configurable Changes to world loading and the \u0026ldquo;Spawn Chunks\u0026rdquo; A dimension that has any player activity, forceloaded chunks, active portals, or Ender Pearls in flight will be considered \u0026ldquo;active\u0026rdquo; and will keep processing chunks and entities Previously, this would only apply if a player was in the dimension or a chunk was forceloaded World Loading and Spawn Chunks # The concept of fixed \u0026ldquo;Spawn Chunks\u0026rdquo; has been removed The game will ensure that the following chunks are fully loaded before the player joins or the server starts, in the same way as spawn chunks formerly were: Chunks loaded by the forceload command Chunks active due to portal activity Ender Pearls thrown in Singleplayer (Singleplayer only) The small area of chunks around the player (Singleplayer only) Chunks required to assign the global world spawn (World creation only) The world loading screen now shows the chunks that the player is about to be placed into, rather than chunks loaded around world spawn The loading screen additionally now includes a progress bar This progress bar accounts for all kinds of chunk loading as mentioned above Developer's Note: Developer’s Note: Spawn chunks incur a memory and performance cost for all players and have outlived their initial technical purpose of keeping the spawn area ready for players to quickly join into. However, we also want to recognise that spawn chunks have enabled a multitude of clever contraptions and farms throughout the years, so simply removing them without having other mechanics in the game enable these designs was never an option. We believe that the niche held by spawn chunks has now been filled by alternative methods of chunk loading, such as using portals or ender pearls, particularly with the changes in this snapshot to how the game loads these chunks before the world starts ticking. Sounds # Happy ghast is now audible from 64 blocks Sounds for chests now plays at a lower volume The volume at which a sound is played at now respects the sound source volume value The \u0026ldquo;Voice/Speech\u0026rdquo; sound source has been rephrased to \u0026ldquo;Narrator/Voice\u0026rdquo; UI # Debug Screen # The debug screen is accessible by pressing F3, as before It can now be accessed from everywhere in the game, not only when in a game world It now displays less information by default Added a new Debug Options screen which can be opened by pressing F3 + F5 It can be used to configure which debug information should be displayed For each item you can choose if it should be turned off, visible when the debug screen (F3) is open, or it should always be visible, even when the debug screen is closed Some debug features that were previously available, like chunk border rendering or entity hitbox rendering, can now be toggled through this debug options screen Some debug features that were not previously available to the community, like Octree visualization, are now accessible through the debug options screen The state of the debug options screen is saved between the launches of the game The debug options screen has the following preset profiles: Default resets everything to the default state Performance shows simple performance metrics, including the FPS meter always visible on screen Developer's Note: Previously the information gathering every frame to render the F3 screen had a significant performance cost. So opening the screen to check you FPS noticably dropped the FPS. Now checking your FPS in `Performance` profile should not affect game performance. Accessibility # A button leading to the Controls screen has been added to the Accessibility Settings screen\nThe \u0026ldquo;Auto-Jump\u0026rdquo; option, as well as the \u0026ldquo;Sneak\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Sprint\u0026rdquo; toggles have been removed from the Accessibility Settings screen The \u0026ldquo;Show Subtitles\u0026rdquo; option has been rephrased to \u0026ldquo;Closed Captions\u0026rdquo; to more accurately describe what it does\nDye Colors now have updated icons\nThe goal with these is to enhance visual cohesion across the dye set while maintaining distinct shapes to support colorblind accessibility Performance Improvements # Entity rendering order was improved for significantly better performance You’ll notice much smoother gameplay in areas with lots of mobs, like mob farms FPS won’t improve much if most of your lag comes from things other than entities, like playing with high render distance while not being near many mobs Developer's Note: This change is quite big, and we would not be surprised if we introduced some ordering issues with this. For example, some part of some mob rendering too early or too late and is not visible or is visually broken. Please play around with this and report the bugs you encounter! Technical Changes # Pack versions now have minor versions The Data Pack version is now 82.0 The Resource Pack version is now 65.0 Pack Formats # The pack versions for data packs and resource packs now have minor versions A minor version increment of the game\u0026rsquo;s pack version is backwards-compatible, meaning all packs made for previous iterations of the same major version will keep working Packs can set compatibility requirements on minor versions in case they rely on resources introduced in a minor version Pack Metadata # The pack.mcmeta format has been updated:\nThe supported_formats field has been removed If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed The pack_format field is now optional If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required Added required field min_format - specifies the minimum version supported A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g [74, 1] Specifying a single integer is interpreted as that major version, e.g. 74 is the same thing as [74, 0] Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone Added required field max_format - specified the maximum version supported A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g [74, 1] Specifying a single integer is interpreted as any minor version, i.e. the minor version is 0x7fffffff Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone For overlay entries: The formats field has been removed If your pack includes any overlay range that includes a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required for all overlay definitions Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed Added required field min_format and max_format with the same formats the fields above with the same name for the pack section Example:\n{ \u0026#34;pack\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;new pack.mcmeta example\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;min_format\u0026#34;: 69, \u0026#34;max_format\u0026#34;: 99 } } Data Pack Version 82.0 # Commands # The summon command now fails when trying to summon monsters while the difficulty is set to Peaceful Game Rules # Removed spawnChunkRadius game rule Data Components # blocks_attacks Item Component # If the damage reduced in an attack is 0, for example by angle threshold not matching, the item can no longer get disabled in the attack, nor cause knockback due to blocking Loot Tables # Added minecraft:entity_interact loot table type which takes the following parameters: target_entity, the entity being interacted with interacting_entity, the optional entity that is interacting with the target_entity tool, the tool used to interact with target_entity Added minecraft:block_interact loot table type which takes the following parameters: block_state, the block state of the block entity being interacted with block_entity, the optional block entity being interacted with interacting_entity, the optional entity that is interacting with the block_state tool, the optional tool used to interact with block_state Fields that specify a target entity in a loot table, such as entity_properties.entity, can additionally target the target_entity and interacting_entity parameter types Added charged_creeper/root loot table for drops when an entity is killed by a Charged Creeper This loot table dispatches on the mob that was killed, to the following loot tables: charged_creeper/piglin charged_creeper/creeper charged_creeper/skeleton charged_creeper/wither_skeleton charged_creeper/zombie Once any mob killed drops an item from this loot table, other mobs killed by the same Creeper will not drop from this loot table Added brush/armadillo loot table for drops when an Armadillo is brushed Added gameplay/turtle_grow loot table for drops when a Turtle grows into an adult Added harvest/beehive loot table for drops when a Beehive or Bee Nest is harvested using Shears Added harvest/cave_vine loot table for drops when a Cave Vine with Glowberries is harvested by interacting with it Added carve/pumpkin loot table for drops when a Pumpkin is carved using Shears World Generation # The initial_density_without_jaggedness field in noise_settings definitions has been replaced with a preliminary_surface_level field initial_density_without_jaggedness was a 3D density function that was used to determine an approximate surface level by scanning for the first point with a density greater than 0.390625 preliminary_surface_level is a 2D density function that should produce the y-level of the approximate surface The minecraft:find_top_surface density function can be used to replicate the previous scanning Density Functions # Added minecraft:find_top_surface # Approximates the topmost surface of a given density function It scans from an upper bound to a lower bound to find the point at which the density changes from negative to positive The upper bound should be as close to the actual surface for best performance The upper bound should never be lower than the actual surface Fields:\ndensity - density function to approximate the surface of upper_bound - 2D density function providing the highest possible y-value lower_bound - integer, lowest possible y-value cell_height - positive integer defining the grid resolution on which to scan Added minecraft:invert # Resolves to 1/argument Fields:\nargument - density function Jigsaw Structures # The max_distance_from_center field may now specify a different restriction on the vertical axis from horizontal This can be specified by an object with fields: horizontal - required integer between 1 and 128 vertical - optional integer between 1 and 4096 (default: 4096) e.g: \u0026quot;max_distance_from_center\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;horizontal\u0026quot;: 20, \u0026quot;vertical\u0026quot;: 500 } The previous format of a single inline value specifying both horizontal and vertical distance is still supported Tags # Block Tags # Added #copper_chests -

These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve.

Some server properties have been moved to game rules, allowing them to be updated while the server is running. Additionally, player icons can now be used in chat, the copper golem has received some improvements and we are shipping a bunch of bug fixes.\nNew Features # Added Halychian language support Changes # Recipes # Hanging Signs can now only be crafted using Iron Chains UI # When adding a new server to the server list, the name is no longer prefilled. When left empty the default name is used. More text inputs now support selecting text by mouse dragging Mouse cursor # Some UI components will now change shape of mouse cursor Examples: text inputs, numeric sliders, buttons, scroll bars Additionally, clickable parts of text labels (like links) will now change cursor to the \u0026ldquo;hand\u0026rdquo;

This does not change our posted Minimum Requirements Developer's Note: We do not expect the update to OpenGL version to affect many people, if any at all. Our posted Minimum Requirements has been OpenGL 4.0 since 2017, and OpenGL 3.3 turned 15 years old recently. Minor Tweaks to Blocks, Items and Entities\nFixed a bug where breaking a Shelf while another player is interacting with it could lead to visual bugs in the player inventory\nCopper Golems hitbox has been tweakedThe hitbox is now 0.49 blocks in width to be able to pathfind through narrow spaces\nCopper Golems can now open doors\nTest Instance Blocks now preserve error markers between world reloads\nAmbient lighting on entities has been adjusted to be more visually in line with blocks and other parts of the gameThe underside of flat surfaces will now be lit from that direction, instead of the opposite direction This mainly affects models containing cubes that are either flat or \u0026ldquo;hollow\u0026rdquo; such as:\nWorn armor Worn Elytra The outside layers on player skins The ribcages of Skeletons or Skeleton Horses The feet of Chickens or Frogs The wings of Phantoms or the Ender Dragon The fins on fish And more! Game Mode Switching # Switching from Spectator Mode to Creative Mode no longer causes the player to stop flying Instead, flight now only gets disabled when switching game modes if the player is near the ground A player is considered to be near the ground if there is a collidable surface (i.e. blocks, Happy Ghasts, boats\u0026hellip;) within 1 block below them Flight will not get disabled if the player was inside a block or collidable entity This is to prevent players from suddenly falling through the ground Developer's Note: This change is a partial revert of a bugfix from a previous snapshot. Even though the old behavior prior to the fix was unintended, the approach we took to fixing flight didn't quite land the way we wanted it to. In response to community feedback, we're trying this new approach as a less disruptive alternative.
