In this week\u0026rsquo;s release we\u0026rsquo;re making it possible to access game rules from the in-game pause screen, through the new world options button. On the data pack side of things, we\u0026rsquo;re introducing a new concept of world clocks, which is an expansion of the work we did on timelines last year. For more information about world clocks and more, browse the full changelog below.\nHappy mining!\nChanges #\rAdditional tweaks to JVM configuration Minor Tweaks to Blocks, Items and Entities #\rThe Tripwire texture is now rendered as alpha cutout instead of transparent UI #\rDebug Screen #\rA day_count debug entry has been split from local_difficulty Game Rules #\rThe Game Rules screen is now accessible in-game through a new World Options screen in the pause menu\nA search bar has been added to the top of the Game Rules screen, both in-game and in the world creation menu\nWorld Options #\rThe difficulty button in the pause menu has been replaced with a button leading to a new screen - World Options.\nThe World Options screen contains the difficulty button as well as a button for changing Game Rules\nThe Game Rules screen is available for all operators and otherwise disabled\nTechnical Changes #\rThe Data Pack version is now 97 The Resource Pack version is now 78 Data Pack Version 97 #\rAdded new block tags Added new fluid tags Changed format of time command to work with World Clocks and Timelines Updated time_check condition to specify a World Clock World Clocks #\rWorld Clocks contain an internal time that increases every tick. They can be defined in data packs under the world_clock registry (i.e. found under data/\u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;/world_clock/\u0026lt;id\u0026gt;.json)\nWorld Clocks can be paused or resumed, and the time of the clock can be changed or queried from the time command Format: object with no fields Timelines #\rAdded a clock field: a World Clock ID, specifies which World Clock the timeline is tied to This field is required, but to match previous behavior the minecraft:overworld clock can be used Added an optional time_markers field, an optional map between namespaced Time Marker IDs and either an int or a Time Marker object, Format: Non-negative int, the tick that the time marker marks Or object with fields: ticks: int between 0 and period_ticks, the tick that the time marker marks show_in_commands: optional boolean, specifies whether the Time Marker will show up in command suggestions Default: false Time Markers #\rTime Markers assign a particular name to a specific (optionally repeating) point in time for a specific World Clock. Time Markers replace the previously predetermined names that could be used by /time set, for example day or night.\nTime Markers will exist within the context of a specific World Clock. This means that even though the different Time Markers are defined by different Timelines, only one Time Marker can exist with a particular id for a particular World Clock. It also means that two World Clocks can have a Time Marker with the same name.\nBuilt-in uses of Time Markers #\rSome Time Markers are used to drive Vanilla game behavior. Usually, they are configured to not show up in /time commands.\nminecraft:wake_up_from_sleep - the time to advance the dimension\u0026rsquo;s default clock to when players in that dimension wake up after sleeping minecraft:roll_village_siege - the time of the dimension\u0026rsquo;s default clock at which the random chance for a Zombie Village siege to occur should be evaluated Commands #\rChanges to swing #\rBoth arguments can now be omitted and will fall back to the following defaults: The entity selector will be @s if omitted Which hand to swing will be mainhand if omitted Changes to time #\rThe time command is now based on World Clocks A clock can be optionally specified as an input for the time command with time of \u0026lt;clock\u0026gt; ...

So, riders of the Overworld – mount up and lead the charge in the Mounts of Mayhem drop!\nNew Features #\rAdded Nautilus and Zombie Nautilus Added Nautilus Armor Added Spear Weapon Updated advancements to include the Nautilus, the Zombie Nautilus, the Zombie Horse, the Camel Husk, and the Parched Added new graphical options \u0026ldquo;Texture Filtering\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Anisotropic Filtering\u0026rdquo; Added Netherite Horse Armor that can be obtained by upgrading Diamond Horse Armor with a Smithing Table Nautilus #\rNautilus is a new neutral aquatic mob Spawns in all ocean biomes Attacks using a Dash attack, if provoked Occasionally attacks Pufferfish within range using the Dash attack Has a Dash skill similar to Camels, used by pressing the Jump button Takes suffocation damage on land Adds the \u0026ldquo;Breath of the Nautilus\u0026rdquo; effect to mounted players Nautilus can be bred and tamed using Pufferfish or a Bucket of Pufferfish Despawn naturally, however become persistent when interacted with by a player A Tamed Nautilus: Can be mounted using a Saddle With a Saddle has a roaming restriction of 16 blocks Without a Saddle has a roaming restriction of 32 blocks Zombie Nautilus #\rZombie Nautilus is a new underwater mob that spawns with a Drowned rider wielding a Trident Zombie Nautilus is only hostile if ridden by a hostile mob Zombie Nautilus behaves similar to the Nautilus except that it cannot be bred Coral Zombie Nautilus #\rThe Zombie Nautilus has a Coral Zombie Nautilus variant that spawns in the Warm Ocean biome Nautilus Armor #\rEquippable on the Nautilus and Zombie Nautilus Comes in Copper, Golden, Iron, Diamond and Netherite versions Parched #\rNew Skeleton variant Spawns at light level 0 in Deserts replacing some of the regular Skeletons Does not burn in sunlight Shoots Arrows of Weakness Is immune to Weakness effect Has a slower rate of fire compared to normal Skeletons, similar to Bogged Does not spawn in caves, following the Husk\u0026rsquo;s spawning rules Camel Husk #\rNew undead Camel variant Spawns a 0 light level in Deserts Does not burn in sunlight Spawns with two riders: A Husk wielding a Spear and a Parched Do not spawn in caves, following Husks spawning rules Is hostile if the rider is a hostile mob Passive without a rider Despawns with other hostile mobs, however becomes persistent when interacted with Favorite food is Rabbit Foot Cannot be bred As a mount they work similar to normal Camels Drops 2-3 Rotten Flesh when killed, with extra 0-1 for each level of Looting Spear Weapon #\rNew weapon that can be crafted in Wood, Stone, Copper, Iron, Gold, Diamond and Netherite versions Each material has different stats for timing, influencing how fast they are to use Has a minimum reach for damage, being too close to a target will yield no damage Has extended maximum reach compared to other tools and weapons Bounces back visually on hit Has two attacks. Jab and Charge Does not cause item interact vibrations Zombies, Husks, Zombified Piglins and Piglins can spawn with the Spear Golden Spear is considered a preferred weapon by Piglins Jab Attack #\rQuick-press primary action button to use Low damage attack with knockback Cooldown between attacks Wooden Spears have the fastest cooldown; Netherite the slowest Can hit multiple enemies Does not destroy blocks Charge Attack #\rPress and hold the secondary action button to use Damage is based on Spear material, the player’s view angle, and the velocity of both the player and the target While holding down the button, the attack goes through three stages before returning to idle: Engaged: The Spear can deal damage, knockback, and dismount mounted enemies if the speed is above the required thresholds Tired: Indicated by the Spear rotating to a vertical position and shaking. The Spear can deal damage and knockback (but not dismount) if the speed is above the required thresholds Disengaged: Indicated by the Spear being lowered, pointing downwards. The Spear gives damage but not knockback or dismount if the speed is above the required threshold The Spear\u0026rsquo;s range when used by mobs is half of that when used by players, but they can deal damage, dismount and knockback at lower speeds than the players Zombies, Husks, Zombified Piglins and Piglins know how to charge with a Spear Lunge Enchantment #\rSpear exclusive enchantment Only works with the Jab attack When doing a Jab attack with Lunge, it propels the player horizontally in the view direction The view angle needs to be perfectly leveled horizontally to achieve maximum lunge distance Using Lunge has a durability cost of 1 for using Lunge across all Enchantment levels Using Lunge consumes hunger points by exhausting the player, similar to sprinting or jumping Level 1 Lunge consumes 1 hunger point, level 2 consumes 2 hunger points, and level 3 consumes 3 hunger points Lunge can only be used if the player has at least 6 hunger points in their hunger bar Does not work when the player is in water or flying with Elytra Advancements #\rAdded the \u0026ldquo;Mob Kabob\u0026rdquo;

resolves some of the transparent geometry rendering issues at a significant GPU cost, previously was hidden behind \u0026ldquo;Fabulous!\u0026rdquo; A new \u0026ldquo;Preset\u0026rdquo; slider was added to the top of the \u0026ldquo;Quality \u0026amp; Performance\u0026rdquo; section Presets, as you would expect based on gaming industry standard, control most of the \u0026ldquo;Quality \u0026amp; Performance\u0026rdquo; settings at once, not only the ones that were previously hidden behind the \u0026ldquo;Graphics\u0026rdquo; setting Available presets are \u0026ldquo;Fast\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Fancy\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Fabulous!\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Custom\u0026rdquo; The default preset is \u0026ldquo;Fancy\u0026rdquo; for new players But for players who are upgrading to this version the preset will be set to \u0026ldquo;Custom\u0026rdquo; to preserve your current configuration UI #\rMenu sliders will now \u0026ldquo;stick\u0026rdquo; to the closest available value when you release them after dragging with a mouse When using keyboard to change slider values, arrow keys will now move the slider to the next available value, not by one pixel as before The inF3 button in the Debug Option screen has been renamed to inOverlay The Single Biome Customization screen now has a search box The language selection screen now has a search box to filter languages Renamed the \u0026ldquo;Show Music Toast\u0026rdquo; option to \u0026ldquo;Music Toast\u0026rdquo; Added a third state to the \u0026ldquo;Music Toast\u0026rdquo; option, allowing it to only be shown in the pause menu Technical Changes #\rThe Data Pack version is now 94.1 The Resource Pack version is now 75.0 The Minecraft Server Management Protocol version is now 2.0.0 Added ClientFps JFR event Experience packets that do not change the player\u0026rsquo;s experience progress or level are no longer sent by the server Added support for KQueue on OSX to improve network connection performance Network Protocol #\rMinecraft Server Management Protocol Version 2.0.0 #\rAdded a new notification server/activity Indicates that a network connection to the server has been initiated Rate limited to 1 notification per 30 seconds Enable authentication from web browsers Authenticate by passing the token in Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header when opening the WebSocket connection Example: Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: minecraft-v1, \u0026lt;token\u0026gt; Requests authenticating this way are subject to Origin header checks. This requires configuration of allowed origins on the server side using management-server-allowed-origins. The default value is empty, meaning Sec-Websocket-Protocol authentication is effectively disabled In the typed_game_rule and untyped_game_rule schemas, the type of the value field has been changed from string to take either a boolean or an integer Also, it now uses the game rule resource location as the key Data Pack Versions 89.0 through 94.1 #\rAdded stopwatch command for keeping track of real time Certain visual and gameplay effects can now be controlled by Environment Attributes World Border interpolation is now dependent on game ticks instead of real time This means the World Border will no longer move when the game is paused It will also respect any changes made by the /tick command Changed loot function filtered to allow running modification when predicate fails Added discard loot function Added new Coral Zombie Nautilus mob variant The Zombie Nautilus variants can be data-driven Item textures were split out of the blocks atlas into a separate new items atlas It means that the commands that were referencing the blocks atlas for item textures now need to reference the items atlas instead Zombie Nautilus Variants #\rZombie Nautilus variants can be data-driven by adding entries to data/\u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;/zombie_nautilus_variant/\u0026lt;id\u0026gt;.json This feature is experimental Fields in file: model - one of: normal, warm asset_id - namespaced id for this variant asset, resolves to assets/\u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;/textures/\u0026lt;path\u0026gt;.png spawn_conditions - a uniform variant selection rule explained below Spawn conditions #\rminecraft:biome #\rChecks if entity is spawning in specific biomes Fields: biomes - single entry, list or a tag describing biomes minecraft:moon_brightness #\rChecks if current moon brightness is within certain range Fields: range - floating point range (a single number or an object like {\u0026quot;min\u0026quot;: 1, \u0026quot;max\u0026quot;: 2}) minecraft:structures #\rChecks if entity is spawning in specific structures Fields: structures - single entry, list or a tag describing structures Commands #\rResource suggestions now show results in any namespace instead of just within minecraft Added stopwatch #\rNew command that allows the creation of a Stopwatch that keeps track of real time Stopwatches do not depend on game ticks They only run when the server/world is running, even when paused Syntax:\nstopwatch create \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; - creates a Stopwatch with the given namespaced ID stopwatch query \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; [\u0026lt;scale\u0026gt;] - shows the elapsed time of the given Stopwatch in seconds and returns it scaled by the given value and truncated. Default scale: 1 stopwatch restart \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; - restarts the given Stopwatch stopwatch remove \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; - removes the given Stopwatch Developer\u0026rsquo;s Note : This command is added to replace the need of using world borders to keep track of real time. The intent is to change the world border to be dependent on game ticks in a future snapshot. If you\u0026rsquo;ve relied on this way of measuring the passage of real time before, please switch to using the new command and let us know if anything doesn\u0026rsquo;t work as intended. Thank you!\nChanges to execute #\rAdded new syntax /execute if|unless stopwatch \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;range\u0026gt; Allows to compare the elapsed time of a given Stopwatch with a floating point value range The Stopwatch value is measured in seconds and has an accuracy of at most a millisecond Example: /execute if stopwatch foo:bar ..10 run say Stopwatch foo:bar has not reached 10 seconds yet Changes to worldborder #\rThe time arguments now specify ticks by default, but can also specify seconds or in-game days using an s or d suffix Game Rules #\rGame rules have been moved into a registry.

It is a map from game rules resource locations to the game rules value. The value type is either integer or boolean depending on the game rule.\nAttributes #\rTimelines #\rTimelines are a new concept defined in data packs under the timeline registry (i.e. found under data/\u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;/timeline/\u0026lt;id\u0026gt;.json).\nTimelines specify game behavior based on the absolute day time (that which is set by /time set). Timelines optionally can specify a period over which they will be repeated.\nPrimarily, Timelines are able to modify game behavior or visuals by applying Environment Attribute modifiers.\nFormat: object with fields\nperiod_ticks: optional integer, defines the duration in ticks over which the timeline will repeat If not specified, the timeline will not repeat tracks: optional map between Environment Attribute IDs and a corresponding Environment Attribute Track object See the section on Environment Attributes below for details Timelines by default have no effect unless they are included by a dimension - see the Dimension Types section below.\nEnvironment Attributes #\rEnvironment Attributes provide a data-driven way to control a variety of visual and gameplay systems.\nEach Environment Attribute controls a specific visual or gameplay effect: for example, minecraft:visual/sky_color controls the color of the sky, and minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates controls whether water can be placed at a given location.\nDeveloper’s Note: This system and many of the introduced attributes should be considered very experimental, and may still change significantly in coming snapshots and releases. In the meantime, we would as always love to hear any feedback or suggestions you may have!\nSources #\rEnvironment Attribute values can be provided by the following Environment Attribute sources (in order of low to high priority):\nDimensions Biomes Timelines Weather (not data-driven) While Biomes act as a source to modify an attribute by position, Timelines can modify an attribute based on time.\nThe \u0026ldquo;effective\u0026rdquo; value of the Environment Attribute (i.e. what will actually show up in game) will be some combination of the values provided by each source according to their priority.\nFor example, in the following scenario:\nThe overworld dimension provides sky_color = #00ff00 (green) The plains biome provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) When the player is in the plains biome, they will see the red sky_color, while anywhere else in the overworld they will see green.\nWhen an Environment Attribute source provides an Environment Attribute, it can:\nOverride the value, such as the plains biome overriding the overworld\u0026rsquo;s sky_color in the above scenario Apply a modifier to a previous value (see section on Modifiers below) Modifiers #\rAs described in the above example, an Environment Attribute source may simply override the value of a particular attribute. However, it is sometimes also desirable to rather apply a modifier to a value provided by a source with lower priority.\nFor example, in the following scenario:\nThe overworld dimension provides water_fog_end_distance = 96.0 The plains biome modifies water_fog_end_distance with a multiply modifier of 0.85 When in the plains biome, the water_fog_end_distance will be resolved to 96.0*0.85 = 81.6, while in any other Overworld biome, it will resolve to 96.0.\nThe kinds of modifiers available depends on the type of Environment Attribute. The most basic modifier, supported by every Environment Attribute, is the override modifier. This behaves purely as an override of the preceding value. If not specified by an Environment Attribute source, the modifier will always be assumed to be override.\nFull descriptions of the available modifiers and their behaviors can be found in the Common Modifiers section below.\nInterpolation #\rWhile modifiers describe how a value provided by one source is applied on the value from a preceding source, interpolation describes the combination of values within a source. Only some Environment Attributes support interpolation. This allows for the smooth transition between two or more values, such as when moving between two biomes.\nBetween multiple Biomes, interpolation is performed on values from a source after modifiers have been applied. Within a Timeline, interpolation is performed on the modifier arguments before they get applied.\nBiomes #\rFor example, in the following scenario:\nThe plains biome provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) The desert biome provides sky_color = #ffff00 (yellow) sky_color is one such attribute that will transition smoothly based on position: for example, in the above scenario, as a player moves from a plains to a desert biome, the sky color will gradually shift from red to yellow. Other attributes, such as water_evaporates, represent discrete values and will not be smoothly transitioned - only the biome exactly at a subject position will be considered.\nSmooth transitions between biomes are based on the biomes within an 8 block radius of the camera. Biomes that occupy a larger portion of that radius and are closer to the camera will have a stronger influence on the final interpolated value.\nTimelines #\rTimelines can define Attribute Tracks - these specify how a modifier for a particular Environment Attribute changes over time by defining keyframes. Depending on the attribute, interpolation may be used between each keyframe. If interpolation is not used, the previous keyframe value will always be selected.\nFor example, a Timeline with a period of 24000 might be set up as following:\nAt time = 0, the timeline provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) At time = 1000, the timeline provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) At time = 6000, the timeline provides sky_color = #ff00ff (magenta) Between time = 0 and time = 1000, the sky color will be red. Between 1000 and 6000, it will shift from red to magenta. Then, from 6000 all the way until the timeline repeats and reaches time = 0 again, the color will slowly shift back to red.\nNote: unlike biomes, if a Timeline uses a modifier instead of an override, interpolation is applied to the modifier arguments rather than the final modified values.\nEnvironment Attribute Map #\rDimension Type and Biome definitions contain a new attributes field, enabling them to define Environment Attributes.\nThis map generally takes the form of an object mapping between Environment Attribute IDs and their corresponding values, for example:\n\u0026quot;attributes\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;minecraft:visual/fog_color\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;#ffaa00\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates\u0026quot;: true\r}\rValues defined as above will always be assumed to use the override modifier.\nThe value object can however be expanded in order to express different modifiers, in the format of an object with the following fields:\nmodifier: optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below) Default: override argument: the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier) How the argument is used also depends on the type of modifier For example, the following definition describes multiplying water_fog_end_distance by 85%:\n\u0026quot;attributes\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;minecraft:visual/water_fog_end_distance\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;modifier\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;multiply\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;argument\u0026quot;: 0.85\r}\r}\rAttribute Track #\rAn Attribute Track specified within a Timeline takes the format of an object with the following fields:\nease - optional Easing Type (see below), used to ease the interpolaton of the value between keyframes Default: linear If the target attribute does not support interpolation, the easing mode will have no effect keyframes - list of keyframe objects, must be ordered by the ticks field: ticks - integer between 0 and period_ticks (if specified), defines the tick (within the period) at which this keyframe\u0026rsquo;s value will be active value - the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier) If no modifier is specified (or override is used), the type of this field is the same as the Environment Attribute itself How this value is used depends on the type of modifier Note: at most two keyframes can be placed on the same tick, creating an immediate transition modifier - optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below) Default: override For example, the following Timeline has a period of 24000, and has an attribute track that modifies only minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance. Because the easing is constant, between tick 362 and 23667 the value is 0.0, while between tick 23667 and 362 it is 0.7.\nLike other Environment Attribute sources, the specified value is used as the argument to the specified modifier. This is then applied on top of sources with a lower priority. In this case the modifier is maximum, so this timeline will only ever increase the value of cat_waking_up_gift_chance to the value specified in the track.\n{\r\u0026quot;period_ticks\u0026quot;: 24000,\r\u0026quot;tracks\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;ease\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;constant\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;modifier\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;maximum\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;keyframes\u0026quot;: [\r{ \u0026quot;ticks\u0026quot;: 362, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: 0.0 },\r{ \u0026quot;ticks\u0026quot;: 23667, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: 0.7 }\r]\r}\r}\r}\rEasing Types #\rEasing Types control the interpolation between two keyframes by applying a curve.

Timelines optionally can specify a period over which they will be repeated.\nPrimarily, Timelines are able to modify game behavior or visuals by applying Environment Attribute modifiers.\nFormat: object with fields\nperiod_ticks: optional integer, defines the duration in ticks over which the timeline will repeat If not specified, the timeline will not repeat tracks: optional map between Environment Attribute IDs and a corresponding Environment Attribute Track object See the section on Environment Attributes below for details Timelines by default have no effect unless they are included by a dimension - see the Dimension Types section below.\nEnvironment Attributes #\rEnvironment Attributes provide a data-driven way to control a variety of visual and gameplay systems.\nEach Environment Attribute controls a specific visual or gameplay effect: for example, minecraft:visual/sky_color controls the color of the sky, and minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates controls whether water can be placed at a given location.\nDeveloper’s Note: This system and many of the introduced attributes should be considered very experimental, and may still change significantly in coming snapshots and releases. In the meantime, we would as always love to hear any feedback or suggestions you may have!\nSources #\rEnvironment Attribute values can be provided by the following Environment Attribute sources (in order of low to high priority):\nDimensions Biomes Timelines Weather (not data-driven) While Biomes act as a source to modify an attribute by position, Timelines can modify an attribute based on time.\nThe \u0026ldquo;effective\u0026rdquo; value of the Environment Attribute (i.e. what will actually show up in game) will be some combination of the values provided by each source according to their priority.\nFor example, in the following scenario:\nThe overworld dimension provides sky_color = #00ff00 (green) The plains biome provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) When the player is in the plains biome, they will see the red sky_color, while anywhere else in the overworld they will see green.\nWhen an Environment Attribute source provides an Environment Attribute, it can:\nOverride the value, such as the plains biome overriding the overworld\u0026rsquo;s sky_color in the above scenario Apply a modifier to a previous value (see section on Modifiers below) Modifiers #\rAs described in the above example, an Environment Attribute source may simply override the value of a particular attribute. However, it is sometimes also desirable to rather apply a modifier to a value provided by a source with lower priority.\nFor example, in the following scenario:\nThe overworld dimension provides water_fog_end_distance = 96.0 The plains biome modifies water_fog_end_distance with a multiply modifier of 0.85 When in the plains biome, the water_fog_end_distance will be resolved to 96.0*0.85 = 81.6, while in any other Overworld biome, it will resolve to 96.0.\nThe kinds of modifiers available depends on the type of Environment Attribute. The most basic modifier, supported by every Environment Attribute, is the override modifier. This behaves purely as an override of the preceding value. If not specified by an Environment Attribute source, the modifier will always be assumed to be override.\nFull descriptions of the available modifiers and their behaviors can be found in the Common Modifiers section below.\nInterpolation #\rWhile modifiers describe how a value provided by one source is applied on the value from a preceding source, interpolation describes the combination of values within a source. Only some Environment Attributes support interpolation. This allows for the smooth transition between two or more values, such as when moving between two biomes.\nBetween multiple Biomes, interpolation is performed on values from a source after modifiers have been applied. Within a Timeline, interpolation is performed on the modifier arguments before they get applied.\nBiomes #\rFor example, in the following scenario:\nThe plains biome provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) The desert biome provides sky_color = #ffff00 (yellow) sky_color is one such attribute that will transition smoothly based on position: for example, in the above scenario, as a player moves from a plains to a desert biome, the sky color will gradually shift from red to yellow. Other attributes, such as water_evaporates, represent discrete values and will not be smoothly transitioned - only the biome exactly at a subject position will be considered.\nSmooth transitions between biomes are based on the biomes within an 8 block radius of the camera. Biomes that occupy a larger portion of that radius and are closer to the camera will have a stronger influence on the final interpolated value.\nTimelines #\rTimelines can define Attribute Tracks - these specify how a modifier for a particular Environment Attribute changes over time by defining keyframes. Depending on the attribute, interpolation may be used between each keyframe. If interpolation is not used, the previous keyframe value will always be selected.\nFor example, a Timeline with a period of 24000 might be set up as following:\nAt time = 0, the timeline provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) At time = 1000, the timeline provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) At time = 6000, the timeline provides sky_color = #ff00ff (magenta) Between time = 0 and time = 1000, the sky color will be red. Between 1000 and 6000, it will shift from red to magenta. Then, from 6000 all the way until the timeline repeats and reaches time = 0 again, the color will slowly shift back to red.\nNote: unlike biomes, if a Timeline uses a modifier instead of an override, interpolation is applied to the modifier arguments rather than the final modified values.\nEnvironment Attribute Map #\rDimension Type and Biome definitions contain a new attributes field, enabling them to define Environment Attributes.\nThis map generally takes the form of an object mapping between Environment Attribute IDs and their corresponding values, for example:\n\u0026quot;attributes\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;minecraft:visual/fog_color\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;#ffaa00\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates\u0026quot;: true\r}\rValues defined as above will always be assumed to use the override modifier.\nThe value object can however be expanded in order to express different modifiers, in the format of an object with the following fields:\nmodifier: optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below) Default: override argument: the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier) How the argument is used also depends on the type of modifier For example, the following definition describes multiplying water_fog_end_distance by 85%:\n\u0026quot;attributes\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;minecraft:visual/water_fog_end_distance\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;modifier\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;multiply\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;argument\u0026quot;: 0.85\r}\r}\rAttribute Track #\rAn Attribute Track specified within a Timeline takes the format of an object with the following fields:\nease - optional Easing Type (see below), used to ease the interpolaton of the value between keyframes Default: linear If the target attribute does not support interpolation, the easing mode will have no effect keyframes - list of keyframe objects, must be ordered by the ticks field: ticks - integer between 0 and period_ticks (if specified), defines the tick (within the period) at which this keyframe\u0026rsquo;s value will be active value - the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier) If no modifier is specified (or override is used), the type of this field is the same as the Environment Attribute itself How this value is used depends on the type of modifier Note: at most two keyframes can be placed on the same tick, creating an immediate transition modifier - optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below) Default: override For example, the following Timeline has a period of 24000, and has an attribute track that modifies only minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance. Because the easing is constant, between tick 362 and 23667 the value is 0.0, while between tick 23667 and 362 it is 0.7.\nLike other Environment Attribute sources, the specified value is used as the argument to the specified modifier. This is then applied on top of sources with a lower priority. In this case the modifier is maximum, so this timeline will only ever increase the value of cat_waking_up_gift_chance to the value specified in the track.\n{\r\u0026quot;period_ticks\u0026quot;: 24000,\r\u0026quot;tracks\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;ease\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;constant\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;modifier\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;maximum\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;keyframes\u0026quot;: [\r{ \u0026quot;ticks\u0026quot;: 362, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: 0.0 },\r{ \u0026quot;ticks\u0026quot;: 23667, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: 0.7 }\r]\r}\r}\r}\rEasing Types #\rEasing Types control the interpolation between two keyframes by applying a curve.

The Spear can deal damage and knockback (but not dismount) if the speed is above the required thresholds Disengaged: Indicated by the Spear being lowered, pointing downwards. The Spear gives damage but not knockback or dismount if the speed is above the required threshold The Spear\u0026rsquo;s range when used by mobs is half of that when used by players, but they can deal damage, dismount and knockback at lower speeds than the players Zombies, Husks, Zombified Piglins and Piglins know how to charge with a Spear Lunge Enchantment #\rSpear exclusive enchantment Only works with the Jab attack When doing a Jab attack with Lunge, it propels the player horizontally in the view direction The view angle needs to be perfectly leveled horizontally to achieve maximum lunge distance Using Lunge has a durability cost of 1 for using Lunge across all Enchantment levels Using Lunge consumes hunger points by exhausting the player, similar to sprinting or jumping Level 1 Lunge consumes 1 hunger point, level 2 consumes 2 hunger points, and level 3 consumes 3 hunger points Lunge can only be used if the player has at least 6 hunger points in their hunger bar Does not work when the player is in water or flying with Elytra Advancements #\rAdded the \u0026ldquo;Mob Kabob\u0026rdquo;

resolves some of the transparent geometry rendering issues at a significant GPU cost, previously was hidden behind \u0026ldquo;Fabulous!\u0026rdquo; A new \u0026ldquo;Preset\u0026rdquo; slider was added to the top of the \u0026ldquo;Quality \u0026amp; Performance\u0026rdquo; section Presets, as you would expect based on gaming industry standard, control most of the \u0026ldquo;Quality \u0026amp; Performance\u0026rdquo; settings at once, not only the ones that were previously hidden behind the \u0026ldquo;Graphics\u0026rdquo; setting Available presets are \u0026ldquo;Fast\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Fancy\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Fabulous!\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Custom\u0026rdquo; The default preset is \u0026ldquo;Fancy\u0026rdquo; for new players But for players who are upgrading to this version the preset will be set to \u0026ldquo;Custom\u0026rdquo; to preserve your current configuration UI #\rMenu sliders will now \u0026ldquo;stick\u0026rdquo; to the closest available value when you release them after dragging with a mouse When using keyboard to change slider values, arrow keys will now move the slider to the next available value, not by one pixel as before The inF3 button in the Debug Option screen has been renamed to inOverlay The Single Biome Customization screen now has a search box The language selection screen now has a search box to filter languages Renamed the \u0026ldquo;Show Music Toast\u0026rdquo; option to \u0026ldquo;Music Toast\u0026rdquo; Added a third state to the \u0026ldquo;Music Toast\u0026rdquo; option, allowing it to only be shown in the pause menu Technical Changes #\rThe Data Pack version is now 94.1 The Resource Pack version is now 75.0 The Minecraft Server Management Protocol version is now 2.0.0 Added ClientFps JFR event Experience packets that do not change the player\u0026rsquo;s experience progress or level are no longer sent by the server Added support for KQueue on OSX to improve network connection performance Network Protocol #\rMinecraft Server Management Protocol Version 2.0.0 #\rAdded a new notification server/activity Indicates that a network connection to the server has been initiated Rate limited to 1 notification per 30 seconds Enable authentication from web browsers Authenticate by passing the token in Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header when opening the WebSocket connection Example: Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: minecraft-v1, \u0026lt;token\u0026gt; Requests authenticating this way are subject to Origin header checks. This requires configuration of allowed origins on the server side using management-server-allowed-origins. The default value is empty, meaning Sec-Websocket-Protocol authentication is effectively disabled In the typed_game_rule and untyped_game_rule schemas, the type of the value field has been changed from string to take either a boolean or an integer Also, it now uses the game rule resource location as the key Data Pack Versions 89.0 through 94.1 #\rAdded stopwatch command for keeping track of real time Certain visual and gameplay effects can now be controlled by Environment Attributes World Border interpolation is now dependent on game ticks instead of real time This means the World Border will no longer move when the game is paused It will also respect any changes made by the /tick command Changed loot function filtered to allow running modification when predicate fails Added discard loot function Added new Coral Zombie Nautilus mob variant The Zombie Nautilus variants can be data-driven Item textures were split out of the blocks atlas into a separate new items atlas It means that the commands that were referencing the blocks atlas for item textures now need to reference the items atlas instead Zombie Nautilus Variants #\rZombie Nautilus variants can be data-driven by adding entries to data/\u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;/zombie_nautilus_variant/\u0026lt;id\u0026gt;.json This feature is experimental Fields in file: model - one of: normal, warm asset_id - namespaced id for this variant asset, resolves to assets/\u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;/textures/\u0026lt;path\u0026gt;.png spawn_conditions - a uniform variant selection rule explained below Spawn conditions #\rminecraft:biome #\rChecks if entity is spawning in specific biomes Fields: biomes - single entry, list or a tag describing biomes minecraft:moon_brightness #\rChecks if current moon brightness is within certain range Fields: range - floating point range (a single number or an object like {\u0026quot;min\u0026quot;: 1, \u0026quot;max\u0026quot;: 2}) minecraft:structures #\rChecks if entity is spawning in specific structures Fields: structures - single entry, list or a tag describing structures Commands #\rResource suggestions now show results in any namespace instead of just within minecraft Added stopwatch #\rNew command that allows the creation of a Stopwatch that keeps track of real time Stopwatches do not depend on game ticks They only run when the server/world is running, even when paused Syntax:\nstopwatch create \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; - creates a Stopwatch with the given namespaced ID stopwatch query \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; [\u0026lt;scale\u0026gt;] - shows the elapsed time of the given Stopwatch in seconds and returns it scaled by the given value and truncated. Default scale: 1 stopwatch restart \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; - restarts the given Stopwatch stopwatch remove \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; - removes the given Stopwatch Developer's Note: This command is added to replace the need of using\rworld borders to keep track of real time. The intent is to change the world\rborder to be dependent on game ticks in a future snapshot. If you've relied\ron this way of measuring the passage of real time before, please switch to\rusing the new command and let us know if anything doesn't work as intended.\rThank you!\rChanges to execute #\rAdded new syntax /execute if|unless stopwatch \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;range\u0026gt; Allows to compare the elapsed time of a given Stopwatch with a floating point value range The Stopwatch value is measured in seconds and has an accuracy of at most a millisecond Example: /execute if stopwatch foo:bar ..10 run say Stopwatch foo:bar has not reached 10 seconds yet Changes to worldborder #\rThe time arguments now specify ticks by default, but can also specify seconds or in-game days using an s or d suffix Game Rules #\rGame rules have been moved into a registry. With that, all game rules have been renamed from their previous camel case names to resource locations in snake case.\nAdditionally, the following game rules have been further renamed:\nannounceAdvancements -\u0026gt; minecraft:show_advancement_messages commandBlocksEnabled -\u0026gt; minecraft:command_blocks_work command_modification_block_limit -\u0026gt; minecraft:max_block_modifications disableElytraMovementCheck -\u0026gt; minecraft:elytra_movement_check The value is inverted accordingly in places that use the resource location disablePlayerMovementCheck -\u0026gt; minecraft:player_movement_check The value is inverted accordingly in places that use the resource location disableRaids -\u0026gt; minecraft:raids The value is inverted accordingly in places that use the resource location doDaylightCycle -\u0026gt; minecraft:advance_time doEntityDrops -\u0026gt; minecraft:entity_drops doImmediateRespawn -\u0026gt; minecraft:immediate_respawn doInsomnia -\u0026gt; minecraft:spawn_phantoms doLimitedCrafting -\u0026gt; minecraft:limited_crafting doMobLoot -\u0026gt; minecraft:mob_drops doMobSpawning -\u0026gt; minecraft:spawn_mobs doPatrolSpawning -\u0026gt; minecraft:spawn_patrols doTileDrops -\u0026gt; minecraft:block_drops doTraderSpawning -\u0026gt; minecraft:spawn_wandering_traders doVinesSpread -\u0026gt; minecraft:spread_vines doWardenSpawning -\u0026gt; minecraft:spawn_wardens doWeatherCycle -\u0026gt; minecraft:advance_weather maxCommandChainLength -\u0026gt; minecraft:max_command_sequence_length maxCommandForkCount -\u0026gt; minecraft:max_command_forks naturalRegeneration -\u0026gt; minecraft:natural_health_regeneration snowAccumulationHeight -\u0026gt; minecraft:max_snow_accumulation_height spawnRadius -\u0026gt; minecraft:respawn_radius spawnerBlocksEnabled -\u0026gt; minecraft:spawner_blocks_work Limits #\rSome game rules that previously did not have a limited value range now do:\nminecraft:max_block_modifications: Minimum 1 minecraft:max_command_forks: Minimum 1 minecraft:max_command_sequence_length: Minimum 0 minecraft:max_entity_cramming: Minimum 0 minecraft:max_snow_accumulation_height: Minimum 0, maximum: 8 minecraft:players_nether_portal_creative_delay: Minimum 0 minecraft:players_nether_portal_default_delay: Minimum 0 minecraft:players_sleeping_percentage: Minimum 0 minecraft:random_tick_speed: Minimum 0 minecraft:respawn_radius: Minimum 0 Added minecraft:fire_spread_radius_around_player #\rControls the maximum distance in blocks that fire can spread around a player This replaces the previous doFireTick and allowFireTicksAwayFromPlayer game rules, which have now been removed Setting it to 0 will disable fire spreading Setting it to -1 will allow fire spreading without players around Limit: Minimum -1 Game Tests #\rIn the game_rules test environment the keys bool_rule and int_rule have been replaced with a single key rules. It is a map from game rules resource locations to the game rules value. The value type is either integer or boolean depending on the game rule.\nAttributes #\rTimelines #\rTimelines are a new concept defined in data packs under the timeline registry (i.e. found under data/\u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;/timeline/\u0026lt;id\u0026gt;.json).\nTimelines specify game behavior based on the absolute day time (that which is set by /time set). Timelines optionally can specify a period over which they will be repeated.\nPrimarily, Timelines are able to modify game behavior or visuals by applying Environment Attribute modifiers.\nFormat: object with fields\nperiod_ticks: optional integer, defines the duration in ticks over which the timeline will repeat If not specified, the timeline will not repeat tracks: optional map between Environment Attribute IDs and a corresponding Environment Attribute Track object See the section on Environment Attributes below for details Timelines by default have no effect unless they are included by a dimension - see the Dimension Types section below.\nEnvironment Attributes #\rEnvironment Attributes provide a data-driven way to control a variety of visual and gameplay systems.\nEach Environment Attribute controls a specific visual or gameplay effect: for example, minecraft:visual/sky_color controls the color of the sky, and minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates controls whether water can be placed at a given location.\nDeveloper’s Note: This system and many of the introduced attributes should be considered very experimental, and may still change significantly in coming snapshots and releases. In the meantime, we would as always love to hear any feedback or suggestions you may have!\nSources #\rEnvironment Attribute values can be provided by the following Environment Attribute sources (in order of low to high priority):\nDimensions Biomes Timelines Weather (not data-driven) While Biomes act as a source to modify an attribute by position, Timelines can modify an attribute based on time.\nThe \u0026ldquo;effective\u0026rdquo; value of the Environment Attribute (i.e. what will actually show up in game) will be some combination of the values provided by each source according to their priority.\nFor example, in the following scenario:\nThe overworld dimension provides sky_color = #00ff00 (green) The plains biome provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) When the player is in the plains biome, they will see the red sky_color, while anywhere else in the overworld they will see green.\nWhen an Environment Attribute source provides an Environment Attribute, it can:\nOverride the value, such as the plains biome overriding the overworld\u0026rsquo;s sky_color in the above scenario Apply a modifier to a previous value (see section on Modifiers below) Modifiers #\rAs described in the above example, an Environment Attribute source may simply override the value of a particular attribute. However, it is sometimes also desirable to rather apply a modifier to a value provided by a source with lower priority.\nFor example, in the following scenario:\nThe overworld dimension provides water_fog_end_distance = 96.0 The plains biome modifies water_fog_end_distance with a multiply modifier of 0.85 When in the plains biome, the water_fog_end_distance will be resolved to 96.0*0.85 = 81.6, while in any other Overworld biome, it will resolve to 96.0.\nThe kinds of modifiers available depends on the type of Environment Attribute. The most basic modifier, supported by every Environment Attribute, is the override modifier. This behaves purely as an override of the preceding value. If not specified by an Environment Attribute source, the modifier will always be assumed to be override.\nFull descriptions of the available modifiers and their behaviors can be found in the Common Modifiers section below.\nInterpolation #\rWhile modifiers describe how a value provided by one source is applied on the value from a preceding source, interpolation describes the combination of values within a source. Only some Environment Attributes support interpolation. This allows for the smooth transition between two or more values, such as when moving between two biomes.\nBetween multiple Biomes, interpolation is performed on values from a source after modifiers have been applied. Within a Timeline, interpolation is performed on the modifier arguments before they get applied.\nBiomes #\rFor example, in the following scenario:\nThe plains biome provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) The desert biome provides sky_color = #ffff00 (yellow) sky_color is one such attribute that will transition smoothly based on position: for example, in the above scenario, as a player moves from a plains to a desert biome, the sky color will gradually shift from red to yellow. Other attributes, such as water_evaporates, represent discrete values and will not be smoothly transitioned - only the biome exactly at a subject position will be considered.\nSmooth transitions between biomes are based on the biomes within an 8 block radius of the camera. Biomes that occupy a larger portion of that radius and are closer to the camera will have a stronger influence on the final interpolated value.\nTimelines #\rTimelines can define Attribute Tracks - these specify how a modifier for a particular Environment Attribute changes over time by defining keyframes. Depending on the attribute, interpolation may be used between each keyframe. If interpolation is not used, the previous keyframe value will always be selected.\nFor example, a Timeline with a period of 24000 might be set up as following:\nAt time = 0, the timeline provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) At time = 1000, the timeline provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) At time = 6000, the timeline provides sky_color = #ff00ff (magenta) Between time = 0 and time = 1000, the sky color will be red. Between 1000 and 6000, it will shift from red to magenta. Then, from 6000 all the way until the timeline repeats and reaches time = 0 again, the color will slowly shift back to red.\nNote: unlike biomes, if a Timeline uses a modifier instead of an override, interpolation is applied to the modifier arguments rather than the final modified values.\nEnvironment Attribute Map #\rDimension Type and Biome definitions contain a new attributes field, enabling them to define Environment Attributes.\nThis map generally takes the form of an object mapping between Environment Attribute IDs and their corresponding values, for example:\n\u0026quot;attributes\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;minecraft:visual/fog_color\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;#ffaa00\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates\u0026quot;: true\r}\rValues defined as above will always be assumed to use the override modifier.\nThe value object can however be expanded in order to express different modifiers, in the format of an object with the following fields:\nmodifier: optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below) Default: override argument: the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier) How the argument is used also depends on the type of modifier For example, the following definition describes multiplying water_fog_end_distance by 85%:\n\u0026quot;attributes\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;minecraft:visual/water_fog_end_distance\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;modifier\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;multiply\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;argument\u0026quot;: 0.85\r}\r}\rAttribute Track #\rAn Attribute Track specified within a Timeline takes the format of an object with the following fields:\nease - optional Easing Type (see below), used to ease the interpolaton of the value between keyframes Default: linear If the target attribute does not support interpolation, the easing mode will have no effect keyframes - list of keyframe objects, must be ordered by the ticks field: ticks - integer between 0 and period_ticks (if specified), defines the tick (within the period) at which this keyframe\u0026rsquo;s value will be active value - the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier) If no modifier is specified (or override is used), the type of this field is the same as the Environment Attribute itself How this value is used depends on the type of modifier Note: at most two keyframes can be placed on the same tick, creating an immediate transition modifier - optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below) Default: override For example, the following Timeline has a period of 24000, and has an attribute track that modifies only minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance. Because the easing is constant, between tick 362 and 23667 the value is 0.0, while between tick 23667 and 362 it is 0.7.\nLike other Environment Attribute sources, the specified value is used as the argument to the specified modifier. This is then applied on top of sources with a lower priority. In this case the modifier is maximum, so this timeline will only ever increase the value of cat_waking_up_gift_chance to the value specified in the track.\n{\r\u0026quot;period_ticks\u0026quot;: 24000,\r\u0026quot;tracks\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;ease\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;constant\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;modifier\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;maximum\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;keyframes\u0026quot;: [\r{ \u0026quot;ticks\u0026quot;: 362, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: 0.0 },\r{ \u0026quot;ticks\u0026quot;: 23667, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: 0.7 }\r]\r}\r}\r}\rEasing Types #\rEasing Types control the interpolation between two keyframes by applying a curve.

This was and stays the default strategy for most solid or translucent full block textures dark_cutout is similar to mean, but blends colors in a way that makes the pixels bordering cutout pixels darker. This was and stays the strategy for leaves and Mangrove Roots. It simulates dark interior of the blocks cutout is a new strategy that always generates a mipmap based on the original texture instead of the previous mipmap. Used for most cutout blocks that became mipmapped in this version. strict_cutout is a modification of cutout that uses stricter alpha cutoff value leading to the textures using this value disappearing at higher mipmap levels. Is used for flowers and similar blocks to avoid artifacts. auto is the default value and will make the game to pick mean for textures that do not contain fully transparent pixels and cutout for those that do alpha_cutoff_bias is a float field for controling the alpha bias for cutout textures Technically there is no limit for this value, it can be negative as well, but it does not make sense to set this higher than 1.0 or lower than -1.0 since the texture will become either fully opaque or fully transparent Default value for this field is 0.0, and it can be increased for textures that can become too transparent/thin at distance, or decreased if it\u0026rsquo;s too \u0026ldquo;opaque\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to increment or decrease this value in fine granuality for finding the sweet spot. As an example, 0.1 is used for kelp textures in order to prevent them being fully trasparent at distance Only used for lower mips of cutout textures, does not change the alpha of first mip level, and has no effect on other textures Glass, Glass Pane and Redstone dust now support translucent textures Added gui/container/nautilus used for the Nautilus inventory UI Block Sprites #\rItem Sprites #\rAdded new item sprites: item/nautilus_spawn_egg item/zombie_nautilus_spawn_egg item/camel_husk_spawn_egg item/parched_spawn_egg item/copper_nautilus_armor item/iron_nautilus_armor item/golden_nautilus_armor item/diamond_nautilus_armor item/netherite_nautilus_armor item/netherite_horse_armor item/leather_horse_armor_overlay Added the following item sprites for the Spear weapon: When in inventory: item/wooden_spear, item/stone_spear, item/copper_spear, item/iron_spear, item/golden_spear, item/diamond_spear, item/netherite_spear When in hand: item/wooden_spear_in_hand, item/stone_spear_in_hand, item/copper_spear_in_hand, item/iron_spear_in_hand, item/golden_spear_in_hand, item/diamond_spear_in_hand, item/netherite_spear_in_hand Entity Sprites #\rUI Sprites #\rAdded new UI sprite: container/slot/nautilus_armor container/slot/spear - Spear icon used in the Smithing Table screen container/slot/nautilus_armor_inventory - Nautilus icon used in Nautilus inventory UI Added new nine-sliced sprites: container/inventory/effect_background container/inventory/effect_background_ambient Removed the following sprites: container/inventory/effect_background_large container/inventory/effect_background_small Celestials Atlas #\rA new celestials atlas has been introduced, including sprites for objects rendered in the sky such as the Sun and Moon Includes sprites from :textures/environment/celestial/.png The following textures have been moved or split: textures/environment/sun.png -\u0026gt;

The arena is ready, the contenders are locked , and the date of the clash is set. I’ve been appointed as the official ringside commentator for today – and I’m going to take my job very seriously. So let’s get a closer look at our challengers! The challengers aren’t waking into the ring – they’re riding! Is that … normal? I mean, this is the Mounts of Mayhem drop after all, so we should probably expect our mayhem to come in mounted form! Spawning in the first corner we have… the camel husk! This is the tallest mount, standing at a whopping 2.375 blocks tall – and that isn’t counting its two riders it spawns with: the husk and the parched! Camel husk #\rThe camel husk and its two riders – a husk and a parched!\nThe husk is a familiar foe to anyone who has spent time in Minecraft’s sandier biomes. This hostile mob is immune to sunlight, and when it spawns in atop a camel husk it’s always with a spear in hand! But more on the spear later – we have another contender waving its bow at me. Don’t you dare fire that thing before the clash has started! Ahem. From the safety of my freshly-dug dirt hole, I can report that the parched is a new hostile mob that attacks with arrows of Weakness! And they hurt. Like the husk, the parched is immune to sunlight, which means dodging their attacks until the break of dawn won’t be a viable strategy. Hiding in a dirt hole however, is! Actually, I can still hear the parched grumbling so let me dig a little further down\u0026hellip; Oh! I appear to have hit water. Luckily, this is where our third contender is found: the zombie nautilus!\nZombie Nautilus #\rZombie nautiluses always spawn with a drowned on board! And those drowned carry tridents. Sounds\u0026hellip; safe?\nThese adorable (if undead) underwater mobs spawn in with a drowned rider – wielding a trident! I’ve also heard rumors of a rare zombie nautilus variant, but the developers haven’t told me how to find it. I know! Maybe we can play a game of “warmer warmer, colder colder” to see if we can stumble upon it! I’ll save it for later, because I have an epic clash to cover! In the fourth corner, we have… the zombie horse!\nZombie horse #\rThis undead equine said “neigh” to staying as a Creative mode spawn egg, and is now going to spend the nights roaming the Overworld’s forests and plains biomes. What’s worse – it will do so together with a zombie rider! Similar to the husk, zombies riding a zombie horse will also be equipped with a spear. So, let’s talk about this new weapon coming to Minecraft! Fight back with a new weapon #\rThe spear is a new tiered weapon coming to Minecraft, meaning you can craft it from wood, copper, iron, gold, diamond – or even Netherite. The spear has two attacks: the jab attack (which I like to call the “please don’t get any closer”–attack) and the charge attack! The charge attack is particularly interesting because it deals more damage depending on how fast you’re moving. Sprint on foot, don your elytra, or grab your favorite steed to test this out! The spear also comes with a unique Lunge enchantment, which gives players an extra burst of speed, and can be strong enough to knock a rider from its mount. Enchanted spears do consume hunger points depending on their enchantment levels – so make sure to pack a potato or two! We have our contenders, now all we need are the champions! That is… *checks notes* YOU! Yes, you! And seeing as all our challengers have ridden into the arena, I reckon you should do the same. The question is: which mount will you pick? The classic horse mount, which can now swim and be equipped with Netherite horse armor? Or perhaps the nautilus, which lets you explore underwater at speed and preserves your air supply? Or maybe you have your sights set on some of the undead mounts in this very arena – the camel husk, zombie nautilus, or zombie horse? Then all you’ll need to do is unseat their riders! Saddle up and get ready – Mounts of Mayhem releases on December 9 in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition! ","date":"26 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/vinc-custom-changelog.github.io/changelog/1.21.11/mom/","section":"Changelog Übersicht","summary":"","title":"Mounts of Mayhem Release","type":"changelog"},{"content":"\rNews\rToday we\u0026rsquo;re celebrating Friday with a second Pre-Release for 1.21.11!

Mobs using minecraft:kinetic_weapon will have their attack range applied in the same way it applies to players Format: object with fields min_range: float, the minimum distance in blocks from the attacker to the target to be considered valid Default value: 0.0, valid from 0.0 to 64.0 max_range: float, the maximum distance in blocks from the attacker to the target to be considered valid Default value: 3.0, valid from 0.0 to 64.0 hitbox_margin: float, the margin applied to the target bounding box when checking for valid hitbox collision Default value: 0.3, valid from 0.0 to 1.0 mob_factor: float, the multiplier applied to the min_range and max_range when checking for valid distance when item is used by a mob Default value: 1.0, valid from 0.0 to 2.0 Tags #\rItem Tags #\rUpdated #piglin_preferred_weapons to include Golden Spears Resource Pack Versions 70.0 through 75.0 #\rTextures for the Leather Horse Armor item and equipment asset have been split into a tinted base layer and an overlay layer Item Sprites #\rAdded new item sprites: item/leather_horse_armor_overlay Textures #\rtexture section of *.mcmeta files has a new alpha_cutoff_bias field that controls alpha bias for cutout textures Technically there is no limit for this value, it can be negative as well, but it does not make sense to set this higher than 1.0 or lower than -1.0 since the texture will become either fully opaque or fully transparent Default value for this field is 0.0, and it can be increased for textures that can become too transparent/thin at distance, or decreased if it\u0026rsquo;s too \u0026ldquo;opaque\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to increment or decrease this value in fine granuality for finding the sweet spot.

Timelines optionally can specify a period over which they will be repeated.\nPrimarily, Timelines are able to modify game behavior or visuals by acting as an Environment Attribute source to apply Environment Attribute modifiers.\nFormat: object with fields\nperiod_ticks: optional integer, defines the duration in ticks over which the timeline will repeat If not specified, the timeline will not repeat tracks: optional map between Environment Attribute IDs and a corresponding Environment Attribute Track object See the section on Environment Attributes below for details Timelines by default have no effect unless they are included by a dimension - see the Dimension Types section below.\nWith the inclusion of Timelines, Environment Attribute sources are processed in the following order (from low to high priority):\nDimensions Biomes Timelines Weather (not data-driven) Examples #\rGametime dependent Skycolor, Cloud Color, Cloud Height and Sun and Moon Angle Custom Sunset\nCustom Sunset\rVanilla Sunset\rInterpolation #\rTimelines can define Attribute Tracks - these specify how a modifier for a particular Environment Attribute changes over time by defining keyframes. Depending on the attribute, interpolation may be used between each keyframe. If interpolation is not used, the previous keyframe value will always be selected.\nFor example, a Timeline with a period of 24000 might be set up as following:\nAt time = 0, the timeline provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) At time = 1000, the timeline provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) At time = 6000, the timeline provides sky_color = #ff00ff (magenta) Between time = 0 and time = 1000, the sky color will be red. Between 1000 and 6000, it will shift from red to magenta. Then, from 6000 all the way until the timeline repeats and reaches time = 0 again, the color will slowly shift back to red.\nNote: unlike biomes, if a Timeline uses a modifier instead of an override, interpolation is applied to the modifier arguments rather than the final modified values.\nAttribute Tracks #\rAn Attribute Track specified within a Timeline takes the format of an object with the following fields:\nease - optional Easing Type (see below), used to ease the interpolaton of the value between keyframes Default: linear If the target attribute does not support interpolation, the easing mode will have no effect keyframes - list of keyframe objects, must be ordered by the ticks field: ticks - integer between 0 and period_ticks (if specified), defines the tick (within the period) at which this keyframe\u0026rsquo;s value will be active value - the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier) If no modifier is specified (or override is used), the type of this field is the same as the Environment Attribute itself How this value is used depends on the type of modifier Note: at most two keyframes can be placed on the same tick, creating an immediate transition modifier - optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below) Default: override For example, the following Timeline has a period of 24000, and has an attribute track that modifies only minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance. Because the easing is constant, between tick 362 and 23667 the value is 0.0, while between tick 23667 and 362 it is 0.7.\nLike other Environment Attribute sources, the specified value is used as the argument to the specified modifier. This is then applied on top of sources with a lower priority. In this case the modifier is maximum, so this timeline will only ever increase the value of cat_waking_up_gift_chance to the value specified in the track.\n{ \u0026#34;period_ticks\u0026#34;: 24000, \u0026#34;tracks\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ease\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;constant\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;modifier\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;maximum\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;keyframes\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;ticks\u0026#34;: 362, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: 0.0 }, { \u0026#34;ticks\u0026#34;: 23667, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: 0.7 } ] } } } Easing Types #\rEasing Types control the interpolation between two keyframes by applying a curve.

This was and stays the default strategy for most solid or translucent full block textures dark_cutout is similar to mean, but blends colors in a way that makes the pixels bordering cutout pixels darker. This was and stays the strategy for leaves and Mangrove Roots. It simulates dark interior of the blocks cutout is a new strategy that always generates a mipmap based on the original texture instead of the previous mipmap. Used for most cutout blocks that became mipmapped in this version strict_cutout is a modification of cutout that uses stricter alpha cutoff value leading to the textures using this value disappearing at higher mipmap levels. Is used for flowers and similar blocks to avoid artifacts auto is the default value and will make the game to pick mean for textures that do not contain fully transparent pixels and cutout for those that do All mipmap levels are once again animated for block animated textures Beacon and Redstone dust now support translucent textures Sounds #\rAdded new sound event for the Nautilus: item.underwater_saddle.equip Fixed bugs in 25w43a #\rMC-53491 - The world border can change in size when the game is paused MC-302669 - Banners sometimes show incorrect textures when viewed from some angles MC-302675 - Some item frames do not render their item correctly after world upgrade MC-302691 - Held and dropped items sometimes fail to render correctly when banners exist in the world MC-302695 - Can use the game mode switcher while the game is paused, and doing so unpauses the game MC-302719 - Debug key binds text is improperly capitalized MC-302724 - The \u0026ldquo;debug.entry.overlay\u0026rdquo; string is improperly capitalized MC-302737 - After using the game mode switcher, you need to press F3 twice to toggle the debug overlay MC-302769 - Several blocks now turn invisible at short distances MC-302790 - The minecraft:apply_impulse effect cannot be used in minecraft:location_changed MC-302849 - Mobs with spears deal too little damage MC-302854 - Glass is less transparent when viewed from far away MC-302872 - Severe color contrast between lava mip levels MC-302887 - Spear charging animation in first person isn’t perfectly mirrored between the main hand and off hand MC-302912 - Zombie nautiluses suffocate out of water, unlike other undead mobs MC-302915 - Mipmapping on cutout textures can cause them to appear larger than they should MC-302963 - Killing a player\u0026rsquo;s mounted nautilus will cause that player to briefly glide upward, unaffected by gravity MC-302984 - Holding a spear in the off hand and attacking an entity adds the spear\u0026rsquo;s attack damage to the attack MC-303032 - Nautiluses can still be controlled normally even when they are babies or untamed MC-303138 - Piglins and hoglins can zombify in the nether MC-303150 - Can\u0026rsquo;t lay in bed during the day even with \u0026ldquo;can_sleep\u0026rdquo; set to \u0026ldquo;always\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;playerSleepPercentage\u0026rdquo; set to 101+ MC-303157 - remove_binomial enchantment effect has a chance of producing out-of-range values MC-303166 - /stopwatch create suggests existing stopwatches MC-303181 - Spears have an attribute modifier for attack_damage for both hands, even though the charge attack does not use it MC-303201 - Zombified piglins attack players in Creative mode MC-303266 - Nautiluses and zombie nautiluses can enter boats MC-303381 - Game crashes when serializing a world spawn point with yaw or pitch values outside of rotation bounds MC-303382 - Player spawn points with rotation values outside of bounds aren\u0026rsquo;t serialized Get the Snapshot #\rSnapshots are available for Minecraft: Java Edition.

In the meantime, we would as always love\rto hear any feedback or suggestions you may have!\rBeispiele: #\rBenötigt das Snapshot Datapack:\nG drücken und \u0026ldquo;Biome Setup\u0026rdquo; auswählen\nwater_evaporates examples:\n/fillbiome ~20 ~20 ~20 ~-20 ~-20 ~-20 minecraft:overworld_wastes\rtry placing water in the Nether!\nSources #\rEnvironment Attribute values can be provided by the following Environment Attribute sources (in order of low to high priority):\nDimensions Biomes The \u0026ldquo;effective\u0026rdquo; value of the Environment Attribute (i.e. what will actually show up in game) will be some combination of the values provided by each source according to their priority.\nFor example, in the following scenario:\nThe overworld dimension provides sky_color = #00ff00 (green) The plains biome provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) When the player is in the plains biome, they will see the red sky_color, while anywhere else in the overworld they will see green.\nWhen an Environment Attribute source provides an Environment Attribute, it can:\nOverride the value, such as the plains biome overriding the overworld\u0026rsquo;s sky_color in the above scenario Apply a modifier to a previous value (see section on Modifiers below) Modifiers #\rAs described in the above example, an Environment Attribute source may simply override the value of a particular attribute. However, it is sometimes also desirable to rather apply a modifier to a value provided by a source with lower priority.\nFor example, in the following scenario:\nThe overworld dimension provides water_fog_radius = 96.0 The plains biome modifies water_fog_radius with a multiply modifier of 0.85 When in the plains biome, the water_fog_radius will be resolved to 96.0*0.85 = 81.6, while in any other Overworld biome, it will resolve to 96.0.\nThe kinds of modifiers available depends on the type of Environment Attribute. The most basic modifier, supported by every Environment Attribute, is the override modifier. This behaves purely as an override of the preceding value. If not specified by an Environment Attribute source, the modifier will always be assumed to be override.\nFull descriptions of the available modifiers and their behaviors can be found in the Common Modifiers section below.\nInterpolation #\rWhile modifiers describe how a value provided by one source is applied on the value from a preceding source, interpolation describes the combination of values within a source. Interpolation is performed on values from a source after modifiers have been applied.\nOnly some Environment Attributes support interpolation. This allows for the smooth transition between two or more values, such as when moving between two biomes.\nBiomes #\rFor example, in the following scenario:\nThe plains biome provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) The desert biome provides sky_color = #ffff00 (yellow) sky_color is one such attribute that will transition smoothly based on position: for example, in the above scenario, as a player moves from a plains to a desert biome, the sky color will gradually shift from red to yellow. Other attributes, such as water_evaporates, represent discrete values and will not be smoothly transitioned - only the biome exactly at a subject position will be considered.\nSmooth transitions between biomes are based on the biomes within an 8 block radius of the camera. Biomes that occupy a larger portion of that radius and are closer to the camera will have a stronger influence on the final interpolated value.\nEnvironment Attribute Map #\rDimension Type and Biome definitions contain a new attributes field, enabling them to define Environment Attributes.\nThis map generally takes the form of an object mapping between Environment Attribute IDs and their corresponding values, for example:\n\u0026#34;attributes\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;minecraft:visual/fog_color\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#ffaa00\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates\u0026#34;: true } Values defined as above will always be assumed to use the override modifier.\nThe value object can however be expanded in order to express different modifiers, in the format of an object with the following fields:\nmodifier: optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below) Default: override argument: the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier) How the argument is used also depends on the type of modifier For example, the following definition describes multiplying water_fog_radius by 85%:\n\u0026#34;attributes\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;minecraft:visual/water_fog_radius\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;modifier\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;multiply\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;argument\u0026#34;: 0.85 } } Common Data Types #\rThe following data types are reused in various parts of the Environment Attributes system and will be referenced in sections below.\nRGB Color #\rFormat can be one of the following:\nA hex color RGB string, in the form #rrggbb A float array with 3 components, between 0 and 1, in the form [r, g, b] An integer in packed RGB form ARGB Color #\rFormat can be one of the following:\nA hex color ARGB string, in the form #aarrggbb A float array with 4 components, between 0 and 1, in the form [a, r, g, b] An integer in packed ARGB form Particle Options #\rA full definition of a particle, including any type-specific properties (as in the /particle command).\nFor example:\n{ \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;minecraft:block_crumble\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;block_state\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;minecraft:dirt\u0026#34; } } Common Modifiers #\rEvery Environment Attribute has a specific value type, which describes how values must be defined as well as what modifiers are available and how they are interpolated. Some are very specific, while others are reused across many attributes.\nAlthough this is not an exhaustive list, the following Attribute Types are used commonly across many Environment Attributes:\nModifiers on Boolean Values #\rArgument format: boolean\noverride and nand or nor xor xnor Modifiers on Float Values #\rArgument format: float\noverride add subtract multiply minimum maximum Modifiers on Color Values #\rArgument format: RGB color (except alpha_blend)\noverride add - component-wise additive color blending subtract - component-wise subtractive color blending multiply - component-wise multiplicative color blending alpha_blend - traditional alpha blending that might be seen in image editing software Argument format: ARGB Color When the argument alpha is 1, it will behave as an override with no blending New Environment Attributes #\rminecraft:visual/fog_color #\rThe color of fog (when the camera is not submerged in another substance).

added to server.properties called enable-code-of-conduct Setting it to true will make the server look for Code of Conduct files in the codeofconduct subfolder in the same folder as server.properties Each file in the folder should have the form \u0026lt;language_code\u0026gt;.txt and be UTF-8 encoded The language shown will attempt to match the player\u0026rsquo;s language If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t

activates sprint Multiple key binds that have the same key assigned to them can now work together, while before only one would work For example, you can now bind D to Jump and Strafe Left to jump and strafe left at the same time The red warning for assigning the same key to multiple key binds is changed to yellow The spectator hotbar menu key can now be rebound It is part of a new Spectator category in the Key Binds screen, alongside the pre-existing Highlight Players key bind Changes #\rPerformance improvements The Chain block has been renamed to \u0026ldquo;Iron Chain\u0026rdquo; Monster Spawn Eggs now have a tooltip warning when the difficulty is set to Peaceful The mob no longer spawns for one tick when an attempt is made to use the Spawn Egg Changes to world loading and the \u0026ldquo;Spawn Chunks\u0026rdquo; A dimension that has any player activity, forceloaded chunks, active portals, or Ender Pearls in flight will be considered \u0026ldquo;active\u0026rdquo; and will keep processing chunks and entities Previously, this would only apply if a player was in the dimension or a chunk was forceloaded Reworked the debug overlay to be less cluttered and more configurable Players seen in the game world of the current server are now always shown in the Social Interactions screen even if they are offline Players now stop flying when switching from Spectator Mode to Creative Mode if they are near the ground A player is considered to be near the ground if there is a collidable surface (i.e. blocks, Happy Ghasts, boats\u0026hellip;) within 1 block below them Flight will not get disabled if the player was inside a block or collidable entity This is to prevent players from suddenly falling through the ground Migrated several server properties into game rules OpenGL 3.3 is now required to play the game, up from 3.2. This does not change our posted Minimum Requirements Developer's Note: We do not expect the update to OpenGL version to affect many people, if any at all. Our posted Minimum Requirement has been OpenGL 4.0 since 2017, and OpenGL 3.3 turned 15 years old recently.\rPerformance Improvements #\rEntity rendering order was improved for significantly better performance You’ll notice much smoother gameplay in areas with lots of mobs, like mob farms FPS won’t improve much if most of your lag comes from things other than entities, like playing with high render distance while not being near many mobs Particles outside the player\u0026rsquo;s view are not rendered anymore, which provides a performance improvement in some cases World Loading and Spawn Chunks #\rThe concept of fixed \u0026ldquo;Spawn Chunks\u0026rdquo; has been removed The game will ensure that the following chunks are fully loaded before the player joins or the server starts, in the same way as spawn chunks formerly were: Chunks loaded by the forceload command Chunks active due to portal activity Thrown Ender Pearls (Singleplayer only) A small area of chunks around the player (Singleplayer only) Chunks required to assign the global world spawn (World creation only) The world loading screen now shows the chunks that the player is about to be placed into, rather than chunks loaded around world spawn The loading screen now has a progress bar This progress bar accounts for all kinds of chunk loading mentioned above Developer's Note: Spawn chunks incur a memory and performance cost for all players and have outlived their initial technical purpose of keeping the spawn area ready for players to quickly join into.\rHowever, we also want to recognize that spawn chunks have enabled a multitude of clever contraptions and farms throughout the years, so simply removing them without having other mechanics in the game enable these designs was never an option.\nWe believe that the niche held by spawn chunks has now been filled by alternative methods of chunk loading, such as using portals or ender pearls, particularly with the changes in this snapshot to how the game loads these chunks before the world starts ticking.\nServer Properties #\rSeveral server properties were removed in favor of making them into game rules, allowing these settings to be changed while the server is running.\nRemoved server property allow-nether in favor of the new game rule allowEnteringNetherUsingPortals Removed server property spawn-monsters in favor of the new game rule spawnMonsters Removed server property enable-command-block in favor of the new game rule commandBlocksEnabled Removed server property pvp in favor of the new game rule pvp Added server property management-server-enabled controlling whether the new Minecraft Server Management Protocol is enabled or not Defaults to false Added server property management-server-port controlling on what port the Minecraft Server Management Protocol is started Defaults to 0, assigning an available port each time management server is started Added server property management-server-host controlling with what host the new Minecraft Server Management Protocol is started Defaults to localhost Added server property management-server-tls-enabled controlling whether the Minecraft Server Management Protocol uses TLS or not Defaults to true Added server property management-server-tls-keystore controlling the path to the keystore file used for TLS Defaults to an empty string A dedicated server won\u0026rsquo;t start when TLS is enabled and no keystore is provided Added server property management-server-tls-keystore-password controlling the password to the keystore file used for TLS Defaults to an empty string Added server property status-heartbeat-interval controlling the interval the management server sends heartbeat notifications to connected clients Defaults to 0, meaning it’s disabled Added server property enable-code-of-conduct Details on this property can be found in the \u0026ldquo;Server Setup\u0026rdquo;

such as: Worn armor Worn Elytra The outside layers on player skins The ribcages of Skeletons or Skeleton Horses The feet of Chickens or Frogs The wings of Phantoms or the Ender Dragon The fins on fish And more!

So opening the screen to check your FPS noticeably dropped the FPS. Now checking your FPS in the`Performance` profile should not affect game performance.\rChat #\rIt is now possible to start chatting while standing inside a Nether Portal The chat will now remain open and unchanged if the player was chatting before being transferred to another dimension Accessibility #\rDye Colors now have updated icons The goal with these is to enhance visual cohesion across the dye set while maintaining distinct shapes to support colorblind accessibility New Old A button leading to the Controls screen has been added to the Accessibility Settings screen The \u0026ldquo;Auto-Jump\u0026rdquo; option, as well as the \u0026ldquo;Sneak\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Sprint\u0026rdquo; toggles have been removed from the Accessibility Settings screen The \u0026ldquo;Show Subtitles\u0026rdquo; option has been rephrased to \u0026ldquo;Closed Captions\u0026rdquo; to more accurately describe what it does The \u0026ldquo;Hide Lightning Flashes\u0026rdquo; accessibility setting has been renamed to \u0026ldquo;Hide Sky Flashes\u0026rdquo; as it includes the End light flashes Technical Changes #\rPack versions now have minor versions The Data Pack version is now 88.0 The Resource Pack version is now 69.0 Some previously hidden debug features have been exposed to players Pack Formats #\rThe pack versions for data packs and resource packs now have minor versions A minor version increment of the game\u0026rsquo;s pack version is backwards-compatible, meaning all packs made for previous iterations of the same major version will keep working Packs can set compatibility requirements on minor versions in case they rely on resources introduced in a minor version Pack Metadata #\rThe pack.mcmeta format has been updated:\nThe supported_formats field has been removed If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed The pack_format field is now optional If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required Added required field min_format - specifies the minimum version supported A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g. [74, 1] Specifying a single integer is interpreted as that major version, e.g. 74 is the same thing as [74, 0] Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone Added required field max_format - specifies the maximum version supported A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g. [74, 1] Specifying a single integer is interpreted as any minor version, i.e. the minor version is 0x7fffffff Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone For overlay entries: The formats field has been removed If your pack includes any overlay range that includes a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required for all overlay definitions Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed Added required fields min_format and max_format with the same formats as the fields above with the same name for the pack section Example:\n{ \u0026#34;pack\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;new pack.mcmeta example\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;min_format\u0026#34;: 69, \u0026#34;max_format\u0026#34;: 99 } } Debug Features #\rSome debug features that were previously removed during compilation are now preserved and can be used by players Individual values can be enabled with JVM properties: First, a global debug flag must be enabled with -DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED or -DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED=true Then, a specific feature can be enabled, for example -DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN or -DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN=true To get the list of all available debug properties, add -DMC_DEBUG_PRINT_PROPERTIES Warning: this is debug code, and the primary intention is to help modders - not for normal play.

We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future.\rShaders #\rThe following unused shaders have been removed: core/position_color_lightmap.vsh core/position_color_lightmap.fsh core/position_color_tex_lightmap.vsh core/position_color_tex_lightmap.fsh A new PER_FACE_LIGHTING flag has been added to the following shaders: core/entity.vsh core/entity.fsh When set, cardinal lighting will be computed separately for front- and back-faces As we now require OpenGL 3.3, we have bumped the version of all shaders from 150 to 330 Changes to Full Screen Passes #\rThe following vertex shaders have been removed, and replaced by core/screenquad.vsh: core/blit_screen.vsh post/blit.vsh post/blur.vsh post/invert.vsh post/sobel.vsh post/screenquad.vsh Vertex shaders for post-processing effects, as well as lightmap generation and full screen blits are no longer are passed the Position attribute, and instead must assign vertex coordinates by gl_VertexID These passes furthermore are only executed with 3 vertices, instead of a full quad Fixed bugs in 1.21.9 #\rMC-383 - In the world selection screen, world names/versions/timestamps can overflow the list to the right MC-2681 - No loading progress bar whenever we create a new world or when the game is loading something MC-26334 - Chat UI is forcibly cleared when killed MC-36783 - Item frames/Glow item frames don\u0026rsquo;t change their hitbox if they contain a map MC-46503 - You can retain entities\u0026rsquo;

A dimension that has any player activity, forceloaded chunks, active portals, or Ender Pearls in flight will be considered \u0026ldquo;active\u0026rdquo; and will keep processing chunks and entities Previously, this would only apply if a player was in the dimension or a chunk was forceloaded World Loading and Spawn Chunks #\rThe concept of fixed \u0026ldquo;Spawn Chunks\u0026rdquo; has been removed The game will ensure that the following chunks are fully loaded before the player joins or the server starts, in the same way as spawn chunks formerly were: Chunks loaded by the forceload command Chunks active due to portal activity Ender Pearls thrown in Singleplayer (Singleplayer only) The small area of chunks around the player (Singleplayer only) Chunks required to assign the global world spawn (World creation only) The world loading screen now shows the chunks that the player is about to be placed into, rather than chunks loaded around world spawn The loading screen additionally now includes a progress bar This progress bar accounts for all kinds of chunk loading as mentioned above Developer's Note: Developer’s Note: Spawn chunks incur a memory and performance cost for all players and have outlived their initial technical purpose of keeping the spawn area ready for players to quickly join into.\rHowever, we also want to recognise that spawn chunks have enabled a multitude of clever contraptions and farms throughout the years, so simply removing them without having other mechanics in the game enable these designs was never an option.\rWe believe that the niche held by spawn chunks has now been filled by alternative methods of chunk loading, such as using portals or ender pearls, particularly with the changes in this snapshot to how the game loads these chunks before the world starts ticking.\rSounds #\rHappy ghast is now audible from 64 blocks Sounds for chests now plays at a lower volume The volume at which a sound is played at now respects the sound source volume value The \u0026ldquo;Voice/Speech\u0026rdquo; sound source has been rephrased to \u0026ldquo;Narrator/Voice\u0026rdquo; UI #\rDebug Screen #\rThe debug screen is accessible by pressing F3, as before It can now be accessed from everywhere in the game, not only when in a game world It now displays less information by default Added a new Debug Options screen which can be opened by pressing F3 + F5 It can be used to configure which debug information should be displayed For each item you can choose if it should be turned off, visible when the debug screen (F3) is open, or it should always be visible, even when the debug screen is closed Some debug features that were previously available, like chunk border rendering or entity hitbox rendering, can now be toggled through this debug options screen Some debug features that were not previously available to the community, like Octree visualization, are now accessible through the debug options screen The state of the debug options screen is saved between the launches of the game The debug options screen has the following preset profiles: Default resets everything to the default state Performance shows simple performance metrics, including the FPS meter always visible on screen Developer's Note: Previously the information gathering every frame to render the F3 screen had a significant performance cost. So opening the screen to check you FPS noticably dropped the FPS. Now checking your FPS in `Performance` profile should not affect game performance.\rAccessibility #\rA button leading to the Controls screen has been added to the Accessibility Settings screen\nThe \u0026ldquo;Auto-Jump\u0026rdquo; option, as well as the \u0026ldquo;Sneak\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Sprint\u0026rdquo; toggles have been removed from the Accessibility Settings screen The \u0026ldquo;Show Subtitles\u0026rdquo; option has been rephrased to \u0026ldquo;Closed Captions\u0026rdquo; to more accurately describe what it does\nDye Colors now have updated icons\nThe goal with these is to enhance visual cohesion across the dye set while maintaining distinct shapes to support colorblind accessibility Performance Improvements #\rEntity rendering order was improved for significantly better performance You’ll notice much smoother gameplay in areas with lots of mobs, like mob farms FPS won’t improve much if most of your lag comes from things other than entities, like playing with high render distance while not being near many mobs Developer's Note: This change is quite big, and we would not be surprised if we introduced some ordering issues with this. For example, some part of some mob rendering too early or too late and is not visible or is visually broken. Please play around with this and report the bugs you encounter!\rTechnical Changes #\rPack versions now have minor versions The Data Pack version is now 82.0 The Resource Pack version is now 65.0 Pack Formats #\rThe pack versions for data packs and resource packs now have minor versions A minor version increment of the game\u0026rsquo;s pack version is backwards-compatible, meaning all packs made for previous iterations of the same major version will keep working Packs can set compatibility requirements on minor versions in case they rely on resources introduced in a minor version Pack Metadata #\rThe pack.mcmeta format has been updated:\nThe supported_formats field has been removed If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed The pack_format field is now optional If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required Added required field min_format - specifies the minimum version supported A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g [74, 1] Specifying a single integer is interpreted as that major version, e.g. 74 is the same thing as [74, 0] Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone Added required field max_format - specified the maximum version supported A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g [74, 1] Specifying a single integer is interpreted as any minor version, i.e. the minor version is 0x7fffffff Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone For overlay entries: The formats field has been removed If your pack includes any overlay range that includes a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required for all overlay definitions Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed Added required field min_format and max_format with the same formats the fields above with the same name for the pack section Example:\n{ \u0026#34;pack\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;new pack.mcmeta example\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;min_format\u0026#34;: 69, \u0026#34;max_format\u0026#34;: 99 } } Data Pack Version 82.0 #\rCommands #\rThe summon command now fails when trying to summon monsters while the difficulty is set to Peaceful Game Rules #\rRemoved spawnChunkRadius game rule Data Components #\rblocks_attacks Item Component #\rIf the damage reduced in an attack is 0, for example by angle threshold not matching, the item can no longer get disabled in the attack, nor cause knockback due to blocking Loot Tables #\rAdded minecraft:entity_interact loot table type which takes the following parameters: target_entity, the entity being interacted with interacting_entity, the optional entity that is interacting with the target_entity tool, the tool used to interact with target_entity Added minecraft:block_interact loot table type which takes the following parameters: block_state, the block state of the block entity being interacted with block_entity, the optional block entity being interacted with interacting_entity, the optional entity that is interacting with the block_state tool, the optional tool used to interact with block_state Fields that specify a target entity in a loot table, such as entity_properties.entity, can additionally target the target_entity and interacting_entity parameter types Added charged_creeper/root loot table for drops when an entity is killed by a Charged Creeper This loot table dispatches on the mob that was killed, to the following loot tables: charged_creeper/piglin charged_creeper/creeper charged_creeper/skeleton charged_creeper/wither_skeleton charged_creeper/zombie Once any mob killed drops an item from this loot table, other mobs killed by the same Creeper will not drop from this loot table Added brush/armadillo loot table for drops when an Armadillo is brushed Added gameplay/turtle_grow loot table for drops when a Turtle grows into an adult Added harvest/beehive loot table for drops when a Beehive or Bee Nest is harvested using Shears Added harvest/cave_vine loot table for drops when a Cave Vine with Glowberries is harvested by interacting with it Added carve/pumpkin loot table for drops when a Pumpkin is carved using Shears World Generation #\rThe initial_density_without_jaggedness field in noise_settings definitions has been replaced with a preliminary_surface_level field initial_density_without_jaggedness was a 3D density function that was used to determine an approximate surface level by scanning for the first point with a density greater than 0.390625 preliminary_surface_level is a 2D density function that should produce the y-level of the approximate surface The minecraft:find_top_surface density function can be used to replicate the previous scanning Density Functions #\rAdded minecraft:find_top_surface #\rApproximates the topmost surface of a given density function It scans from an upper bound to a lower bound to find the point at which the density changes from negative to positive The upper bound should be as close to the actual surface for best performance The upper bound should never be lower than the actual surface Fields:\ndensity - density function to approximate the surface of upper_bound - 2D density function providing the highest possible y-value lower_bound - integer, lowest possible y-value cell_height - positive integer defining the grid resolution on which to scan Added minecraft:invert #\rResolves to 1/argument Fields:\nargument -

These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve.

Seeing the many creative ways you've been using this new block, we've decided to revert the change from last week that positioned items at the bottom of the shelf, as we agree that having the items centered provides more creative opportunities when building.\rUI #\rChat #\rIt is now possible to start chatting while standing inside a Nether Portal The chat will now remain open and unchanged if the player was chatting before being transferred to another dimension Technical Changes #\rThe Data Pack version is now 83.1 The Resource Pack version is now 65.2 Added new display transform \u0026ldquo;on_shelf\u0026rdquo; Used for displaying items on the Shelf Data Pack Version 83.1 #\rBlock States #\rAdded align_items_to_bottom block state property to the Shelf block If false the items on the Shelf will ignore the vertical translation of the on_shelf item display transform and will be rendered vertically aligned to the middle of the Shelf If true the items on the Shelf will be rendered upward from the bottom of the Shelf and will respect the vertical translation of the on_shelf item display transform Default is false (items are aligned to the middle of the Shelf) Attributes #\rRUN_COMMAND Click Event #\rPreviously, if the command field contained a command that required a signed message (/say, /me, /msg, /tell, /w, /teammsg, /tm), it would be silently discarded Instead, a screen will be shown that lets the user insert the command into the chat window or copy the command to their clipboard if the chat window can\u0026rsquo;t be opened Enchantments #\rexplode Effects #\rNew field: block_effects - specifies per-block particles. Each block particle is randomly chosen according to weights. A set limit of block particles is spawned each tick from all explosions that tick.\nFormat: List of entries:\nweight: Non-negative integer representing the random weight for this entry being chosen particle: The particle to spawn scaling: Optional scaling to apply between explosion center and block position, or 1.0 if not specified speed: Optional scaling to apply to the speed of the particle, or 1.0 if not specified Tags #\rItem Tags #\rAdded #shearable_from_copper_golem - all items that can be removed from the Copper Golem\u0026rsquo;s head slot via Shears Resource Pack Version 65.2 #\rTextures #\rAdded a new texture: environment/end_flash.png Sounds #\rSound Events #\rAdded new sound event: weather.end_flash Fixed bugs in 25w33a #\rMC-26334 - Chat UI is forcibly cleared when killed MC-46503 - You can retain entities\u0026rsquo; shaders by running the \u0026ldquo;/kill\u0026rdquo; command while in spectator mode MC-69216 - Switching to spectator mode while fishing keeps rod cast MC-98322 - Flying after shifting between Creative/Spectator MC-99785 - You can leash entities in spectator mode MC-119417 - A spectator can occupy a bed if they enter it and then are switched to spectator mode MC-165991 - TNT explosion no longer shows additional smoke particles since 1.15 Pre-release 1 MC-173730 - Shift-clicking water buckets against a waterloggable block doesn\u0026rsquo;t place the water beside the waterloggable block MC-183784 - Visual bug to the Game Mode Switcher debug menu after resizing the window MC-187850 - \u0026ldquo;run_command\u0026rdquo; click_event doesn\u0026rsquo;t work in written books if chat is hidden MC-191669 - Sprinting is disabled when switching your gamemode to spectator while sprinting into a block or general obstruction MC-232968 - Spectators can prevent the closing animation of a chest/barrel when viewing it at the same time as a non-spectator MC-238146 - When you switch to Spectator mode while sleeping, the night never skips MC-259571 - Last player game mode not saved after player dies or the game is reloaded MC-270172 - Client and server desync for hooked players when changing gamemode to spectator MC-297898 - Entering a dialog temporarily closes the chat and clears anything the player was currently typing MC-299548 - \u0026ldquo;run_command\u0026rdquo; dialog actions don\u0026rsquo;t work if chat is hidden MC-299823 - Minecraft shaders cause C7050 warnings MC-299873 - Selection boxes of plain messages within dialogs can get cut off MC-300034 - Dolphins can ride boats MC-300057 - Monsters still spawn for a tick when spawning them with a Spawn Egg in Peaceful MC-300417 - The copper pickaxe is not part of the #cluster_max_harvestables item tag MC-300457 - Dialog is unescapable when action or exit_action is set to run_command with a command that would produce a signed chat message MC-300722 - Hoppers appear to randomly stop draining items through shelves MC-300732 - Loaded ender pearls are deleted when viewing the end credits for the first time when enderPearlsVanishOnDeath is true MC-300739 - Server crash when generating custom structures containing shelf blocks MC-300746 - Missing translation for copper wall torch MC-300747 - Cannot see villager\u0026rsquo;s profession layer behind slime ","date":"19 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/vinc-custom-changelog.github.io/changelog/1.21.9/25w33a/","section":"Changelog Übersicht","summary":"","title":"25w33a Changelog","type":"changelog"},{"content":"\rNews\rSlicedlime Videos:\ngenerell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_TLVuM5FUM technical: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDYmkVMtE9k This week it\u0026rsquo;s time for a smaller snapshot with a new main menu panorama, code of conducts for servers and much tinkering and fixing with our new friends, the Copper Golems. Happy mining!\nDeveloper's Note: Developer's Note: The rendering changes introduced in 25w31a for entities are now expanded to affect block entities and items. Please report any issues you encounter in these areas.\rUpdate: We have now released Snapshot 25w34b to fix some connectivity errors with Realms.\nFixed bugs in 25w34b #\rMC-300911 - Glowing item \u0026amp; block displays no longer glow New Features #\rServers can now have an in-game Code of Conduct Server Code of Conduct #\rWhen connecting to a server, a Code of Conduct screen can now be shown.\nAccepting the Code of Conduct is required to play on the server A checkbox is available for not showing the same Code of Conduct in the future If the Code of Conduct changes, it will be shown again Server Setup #\rA new boolean field has been added to server.properties called enable-code-of-conduct Setting it to true will make the server look for code of conduct files in the codeofconduct subfolder in the same folder as server.properties Each file in the folder should have the form \u0026lt;language_code\u0026gt;.txt The language shown will attempt to match the player\u0026rsquo;s language If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, the en_us code of conduct will be used If that also doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, an arbitrary available entry is used Changes #\rThe main menu now has an updated background panorama showing Copper Golems in a Village The End Light Flashes #\rThe sound effect produced by a flash now has a higher delay The \u0026ldquo;Hide Lightning Flashes\u0026rdquo; accessibility setting has been renamed to \u0026ldquo;Hide Sky Flashes\u0026rdquo; and now also disables the End Flashes When the flash is disabled by the setting the world will not be lit by the flash, but the flash source will still be visible in the sky and the sound effect will still play Minor Tweaks to Blocks, Items and Entities #\rThe eyes of the Copper Golem are now invisible as well when splashed with Potion of Invisibility Copper Golems hitbox has been tweaked The hitbox is now 0.6 blocks in width to be able to pathfind through open doors The hitbox is now 1.01 blocks in height to not get stuck in certain blocks Sounds #\rCopper Golem \u0026amp;

This one includes another big batch of bug fixes, copper golem polishing and our beloved friend can now open doors. Happy mining!\u0026quot;\nSliced Lime Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu1O2wH0BCg Changes #\rOpenGL 3.3 is now required to play the game, up from 3.2. This does not change our posted Minimum Requirements Developer's Note: We do not expect the update to OpenGL version to affect many people, if any at all. Our posted Minimum Requirements has been OpenGL 4.0 since 2017, and OpenGL 3.3 turned 15 years old recently.\rMinor Tweaks to Blocks, Items and Entities\nFixed a bug where breaking a Shelf while another player is interacting with it could lead to visual bugs in the player inventory\nCopper Golems hitbox has been tweakedThe hitbox is now 0.49 blocks in width to be able to pathfind through narrow spaces\nCopper Golems can now open doors\nTest Instance Blocks now preserve error markers between world reloads\nAmbient lighting on entities has been adjusted to be more visually in line with blocks and other parts of the gameThe underside of flat surfaces will now be lit from that direction, instead of the opposite direction This mainly affects models containing cubes that are either flat or \u0026ldquo;hollow\u0026rdquo; such as:\nWorn armor Worn Elytra The outside layers on player skins The ribcages of Skeletons or Skeleton Horses The feet of Chickens or Frogs The wings of Phantoms or the Ender Dragon The fins on fish And more! Game Mode Switching #\rSwitching from Spectator Mode to Creative Mode no longer causes the player to stop flying Instead, flight now only gets disabled when switching game modes if the player is near the ground A player is considered to be near the ground if there is a collidable surface (i.e. blocks, Happy Ghasts, boats\u0026hellip;) within 1 block below them Flight will not get disabled if the player was inside a block or collidable entity This is to prevent players from suddenly falling through the ground Developer's Note: This change is a partial revert of a bugfix from a previous snapshot. Even though the old behavior prior to the fix was unintended, the approach we took to fixing flight didn't quite land the way we wanted it to. In response to community feedback, we're trying this new approach as a less disruptive alternative.\rMinecraft Server Management Protocol #\rClients must authenticate to access the API\nClients should supply an Authorization bearer token header with a server specific secret The secret is configured in the server properties file management-server-secret= The secret should be exactly 40 alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) The secret will be automatically generated if the server property is empty Unauthorized requests are rejected with 401 Unauthorized TLS is enabled by default\nCan be disabled in the server properties file\nmanagement-server-tls-enabled=false Requires a keystore file to be set in the server properties file\nmanagement-server-tls-keystore=path/to/keystore.p12 The keystore file must be in PKCS12 format\nKeystore password can be set in the following ways, in order of priority\nEnvironment variable: MINECRAFT_MANAGEMENT_TLS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD JVM argument: -Dmanagement.tls.keystore.password= Server property: management-server-tls-keystore-password= Server Properties #\rDefault value of management-server-port was changed from 25585 to 0, assigning an available port each time management server is started Added server property management-server-tls-enabled controlling whether the Minecraft Server Management Protocol uses TLS or not Defaults to true Added server property management-server-tls-keystore controlling the path to the keystore file used for TLS Defaults to an empty string A dedicated server won\u0026rsquo;t start when TLS is enabled and no keystore is provided Added server property management-server-tls-keystore-password controlling the password to the keystore file used for TLS Defaults to an empty string Game Rules #\rAdded spawnerBlocksEnabled game rule controlling if Spawner Blocks should be enabled or not Defaults to true Mob Spawning #\rLogic for choosing type of equipment for mobs spawning with equipment has been tweaked to add Copper as a possibility The initial roll to choose a type now chooses between Leather, Copper and Gold The chance to increase an armor tier has increased from 9.5% to 10.87% Sounds #\rSome sound sliders in the Music \u0026amp; Sound Options now play a preview sound when adjusting the setting outside a world UI #\rThe Resource Pack and Data Pack selection screens now have a search box Technical Changes #\rThe Data Pack version is now 87.0\nThe Resource Pack version is now 69.0\nSome previously hidden debug features have been exposed to players\nDebug features #\rSome debug features that were previously removed during compilation are now preserved and can be used by players Individual values can be enabled with JVM properties: First, a global debug flag must be enabled with -DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED or -DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED=true Then, a specific feature can be enabled, for example -DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN or -DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN=true To get the list of all available debug properties, add -DMC_DEBUG_PRINT_PROPERTIES Warning: this is debug code.

In this final release of 2025 we\u0026rsquo;re (among other things) upgrading our runtime version of Java, giving villager trades the data-driven treatment, and adding a new swing command that swings the arms of entities. Finally, all our builds will now be unobfuscated moving forward.\nDid we miss something? Oh, yeah! This snapshot marks the beginning of our new version numbering system for Minecraft on Java Edition. We\u0026rsquo;ll see you next year for more snapshots and the eventual release of what will be Java Edition 26.1!\nHappy mining!\nChanges #\rWhat trades are unlocked by villager professions are now determined using deterministic random sequences, like loot drops and barter loot The algorithm that maps block and sky light levels to how bright things appear on screen has been fully rewritten A new lightmap debug renderer was introduced, which can be enabled using the F3 + 4 keybind Lightmap Algorithm Changes #\rThe new algorithm is supposed to mostly provide the same overall results as before, but: It is simpler and more straightforward, and fixes multiple issues of the previous one, as listed in the Fixed Bugs section below The Darkness effect and world darkening effect of the Wither fight now works the same way in all dimensions The Night Vision effect now simply adds ambient light instead of scaling the resulting colors It means that fully dark areas no longer look brighter than areas lit by block or sky light More aspects of the algorithm such as block light tint, ambient light color and night vision color are now data-driven through environment attributes, as described in the Data Pack section below Lightmap Debug Renderer #\rA new debug renderer for the lightmap was added, which can be enabled using the F3 + 4 keybind It is mutually exclusive with FPS/TPS and networking charts It shows the lightmap texture in real-time in the bottom right corner of the screen The vertical axis of the texture represent sky light levels (0-15 from bottom to top) The horizontal axis of the texture represent block light levels (0-15 from left to right) The color of each pixel represents the resulting color that will be applied to blocks and entities lit with the corresponding block and sky light levels UI #\rDebug Screen #\rThe looking_at_block and looking_at_fluid debug entries no longer show tags\nNew debug entries have been added:\nlooking_at_block_tags looking_at_fluid_tags looking_at_entity_tags Renamed debug entries:\nlooking_at_block -\u0026gt;
