Our final set of features for Mounts of Mayhem brings the game\u0026rsquo;s strongest armor tier to your favorite mount – with Netherite horse armor! As well as making your steed more stylish, Netherite horse armor will also make them sturdier, perfect for all those mounted challenges. On the submerged side of things, explorers of warmer waters can now swim-ble upon a rare variant of the zombie nautilus..\nWith this week\u0026rsquo;s snapshot, we\u0026rsquo;re also introducing a new concept for data packs called timelines, that can modify game behavior based on the in-game day time – more about that in the full changelog below.\nHappy mining!\nNew Features #\rUpdated the panorama for the Mounts of Mayhem drop Added Netherite Horse Armor that can be obtained by upgrading Diamond Horse Armor with a Smithing Table Spear Weapon #\rSpears are now less forgiving if you miss a charge attack Coral Zombie Nautilus #\rAdded a new variant of the Zombie Nautilus mob: the Coral Zombie Nautilus It Spawns in Warm Oceans, replacing the normal Zombie Nautilus /summon minecraft:zombie_nautilus ~ ~ ~ {variant:warm,attributes:[{id:\"minecraft:burning_time\",base:0}]}\rCamel Husk #\rDrops 2-3 Rotten Flesh when killed, with extra 0-1 for each level of Looting Advancements #\rAdded the \u0026ldquo;Mob Kabob\u0026rdquo; advancement for spearing 5 enemies with a Charge attack Changes #\rZombie Horses, Camel Husks and Nautili become persistent with any interaction from a player, not just riding them Video memory impact of anisotropic filtering was reduced, but still remains quite high The color of the sky during sunrises and sunsets is now affected by rain and thunder Technical Changes #\rThe Data Pack version is now 93.0 The Resource Pack version is now 73.0 Data Pack Version 93.0 #\rAdded new Coral Zombie Nautilus mob variant\nThe Zombie Nautilus variants can be data-driven:\nBenötigt das Snapshot Datapack und Resourcepack:\n/summon minecraft:zombie_nautilus ~ ~ ~ {variant:custom,NoAI:1b,attributes:[{id:\"minecraft:burning_time\",base:0}]}\rItem textures were split out of the blocks atlas into a separate new items atlas\nIt means that the commands that were referencing the blocks atlas for item textures now need to reference the items atlas instead Zombie Nautilus Variants #\rZombie Nautilus variants can be data-driven by adding entries to data/\u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;/zombie_nautilus_variant/\u0026lt;id\u0026gt;.json This feature is experimental Fields in file: model - one of: normal, warm asset_id - namespaced id for this variant asset, resolves to assets/\u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;/textures/\u0026lt;path\u0026gt;.png spawn_conditions - a uniform variant selection rule explained below Spawn conditions #\rminecraft:biome #\rChecks if entity is spawning in specific biomes Fields: biomes - single entry, list or a tag describing biomes minecraft:moon_brightness #\rChecks if current moon brightness is within certain range Fields: range - floating point range (a single number or an object like {\u0026quot;min\u0026quot;: 1, \u0026quot;max\u0026quot;: 2}) minecraft:structures #\rChecks if entity is spawning in specific structures Fields: structures - single entry, list or a tag describing structures Game Rules #\rThe limit for the minecraft:max_entity_cramming game rule has been changed to a minimum of 0 Data Components #\rminecraft:piercing_weapon and minecraft:kinetic_weapon data components now have bounds on their reach parameters: min_reach: is now valid from 0.0 to 128.0 max_reach: is now valid from 0.0 to 128.0 hitbox_margin: is now valid from 0.0 to 1.0 Timelines #\rTimelines are a new experimental concept defined in data packs under the timeline registry (i.e. found under data/\u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;/timeline/\u0026lt;id\u0026gt;.json).\nTimelines specify game behavior based on the absolute day time (that which is set by /time set). Timelines optionally can specify a period over which they will be repeated.\nPrimarily, Timelines are able to modify game behavior or visuals by acting as an Environment Attribute source to apply Environment Attribute modifiers.\nFormat: object with fields\nperiod_ticks: optional integer, defines the duration in ticks over which the timeline will repeat If not specified, the timeline will not repeat tracks: optional map between Environment Attribute IDs and a corresponding Environment Attribute Track object See the section on Environment Attributes below for details Timelines by default have no effect unless they are included by a dimension - see the Dimension Types section below.\nWith the inclusion of Timelines, Environment Attribute sources are processed in the following order (from low to high priority):\nDimensions Biomes Timelines Weather (not data-driven) Interpolation #\rTimelines can define Attribute Tracks - these specify how a modifier for a particular Environment Attribute changes over time by defining keyframes. Depending on the attribute, interpolation may be used between each keyframe. If interpolation is not used, the previous keyframe value will always be selected.\nFor example, a Timeline with a period of 24000 might be set up as following:\nAt time = 0, the timeline provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) At time = 1000, the timeline provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) At time = 6000, the timeline provides sky_color = #ff00ff (magenta) Between time = 0 and time = 1000, the sky color will be red. Between 1000 and 6000, it will shift from red to magenta. Then, from 6000 all the way until the timeline repeats and reaches time = 0 again, the color will slowly shift back to red.\nNote: unlike biomes, if a Timeline uses a modifier instead of an override, interpolation is applied to the modifier arguments rather than the final modified values.\nAttribute Tracks #\rAn Attribute Track specified within a Timeline takes the format of an object with the following fields:\nease - optional Easing Type (see below), used to ease the interpolaton of the value between keyframes Default: linear If the target attribute does not support interpolation, the easing mode will have no effect keyframes - list of keyframe objects, must be ordered by the ticks field: ticks - integer between 0 and period_ticks (if specified), defines the tick (within the period) at which this keyframe\u0026rsquo;s value will be active value - the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier) If no modifier is specified (or override is used), the type of this field is the same as the Environment Attribute itself How this value is used depends on the type of modifier Note: at most two keyframes can be placed on the same tick, creating an immediate transition modifier - optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below) Default: override For example, the following Timeline has a period of 24000, and has an attribute track that modifies only minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance. Because the easing is constant, between tick 362 and 23667 the value is 0.0, while between tick 23667 and 362 it is 0.7.\nLike other Environment Attribute sources, the specified value is used as the argument to the specified modifier. This is then applied on top of sources with a lower priority. In this case the modifier is maximum, so this timeline will only ever increase the value of cat_waking_up_gift_chance to the value specified in the track.\n{ \u0026#34;period_ticks\u0026#34;: 24000, \u0026#34;tracks\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ease\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;constant\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;modifier\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;maximum\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;keyframes\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;ticks\u0026#34;: 362, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: 0.0 }, { \u0026#34;ticks\u0026#34;: 23667, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: 0.7 } ] } } } Easing Types #\rEasing Types control the interpolation between two keyframes by applying a curve. The following built-in Easing Types are provided:\nconstant - always selects the previous keyframe linear in_back in_bounce in_circ in_cubic in_elastic in_expo in_quad in_quart in_quint in_sine in_out_back in_out_bounce in_out_circ in_out_cubic in_out_elastic in_out_expo in_out_quad in_out_quart in_out_quint in_out_sine out_back out_bounce out_circ out_cubic out_elastic out_expo out_quad out_quart out_quint out_sine An Easing Type may also be specified with a Cubic Bézier in the format: {\r\u0026quot;cubic_bezier\u0026quot;: [ x1, y1, x2, y2 ] }\nx1: float between 0 and 1, x-coordinate of the first control point y1: float, y-coordinate of the first control point x2: float between 0 and 1, x-coordinate of the second control point y2: float, y-coordinate of the second control point Developer's Note: To play around with and visualize easings, easings.net and cubic-bezier.com are great references!\reasings.net cubic-bezier.com Common Data Types #\rMob Activity #\rA string ID from the minecraft:activity built-in registry.

This was and stays the default strategy for most solid or translucent full block textures dark_cutout is similar to mean, but blends colors in a way that makes the pixels bordering cutout pixels darker. This was and stays the strategy for leaves and Mangrove Roots. It simulates dark interior of the blocks cutout is a new strategy that always generates a mipmap based on the original texture instead of the previous mipmap. Used for most cutout blocks that became mipmapped in this version strict_cutout is a modification of cutout that uses stricter alpha cutoff value leading to the textures using this value disappearing at higher mipmap levels.

The default value is empty, meaning Sec-Websocket-Protocol authentication is effectively disabled Data Pack Version 90.0 #\rCertain visual and gameplay effects can now be controlled by Environment Attributes Commands #\rResource suggestions now show results in any namespace instead of just within minecraft Changed stopwatch #\rSwitched the order of the id argument Example: /stopwatch foo:bar create is now /stopwatch create foo:bar query now returns the queried value and takes in a new scale argument The returned value will be scaled by that argument and truncated The scale is optional and will default to 1 if omitted Example: /stopwatch query foo:bar 20 to get the elapsed time in ticks Environment Attributes #\rEnvironment Attributes provide a data-driven way to control a variety of visual and gameplay systems.\nEach Environment Attribute controls a specific visual or gameplay effect: for example, minecraft:visual/sky_color controls the color of the sky, and minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates controls whether water can be placed at a given location.\nDeveloper's Note: This system and many of the introduced attributes\rshould be considered very experimental, and may still change significantly\rin coming snapshots and releases. In the meantime, we would as always love\rto hear any feedback or suggestions you may have!\rBeispiele: #\rBenötigt das Snapshot Datapack:\nG drücken und \u0026ldquo;Biome Setup\u0026rdquo; auswählen\nwater_evaporates examples:\n/fillbiome ~20 ~20 ~20 ~-20 ~-20 ~-20 minecraft:overworld_wastes\rtry placing water in the Nether!\nSources #\rEnvironment Attribute values can be provided by the following Environment Attribute sources (in order of low to high priority):\nDimensions Biomes The \u0026ldquo;effective\u0026rdquo; value of the Environment Attribute (i.e. what will actually show up in game) will be some combination of the values provided by each source according to their priority.\nFor example, in the following scenario:\nThe overworld dimension provides sky_color = #00ff00 (green) The plains biome provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) When the player is in the plains biome, they will see the red sky_color, while anywhere else in the overworld they will see green.\nWhen an Environment Attribute source provides an Environment Attribute, it can:\nOverride the value, such as the plains biome overriding the overworld\u0026rsquo;s sky_color in the above scenario Apply a modifier to a previous value (see section on Modifiers below) Modifiers #\rAs described in the above example, an Environment Attribute source may simply override the value of a particular attribute. However, it is sometimes also desirable to rather apply a modifier to a value provided by a source with lower priority.\nFor example, in the following scenario:\nThe overworld dimension provides water_fog_radius = 96.0 The plains biome modifies water_fog_radius with a multiply modifier of 0.85 When in the plains biome, the water_fog_radius will be resolved to 96.0*0.85 = 81.6, while in any other Overworld biome, it will resolve to 96.0.\nThe kinds of modifiers available depends on the type of Environment Attribute. The most basic modifier, supported by every Environment Attribute, is the override modifier. This behaves purely as an override of the preceding value. If not specified by an Environment Attribute source, the modifier will always be assumed to be override.\nFull descriptions of the available modifiers and their behaviors can be found in the Common Modifiers section below.\nInterpolation #\rWhile modifiers describe how a value provided by one source is applied on the value from a preceding source, interpolation describes the combination of values within a source. Interpolation is performed on values from a source after modifiers have been applied.\nOnly some Environment Attributes support interpolation. This allows for the smooth transition between two or more values, such as when moving between two biomes.\nBiomes #\rFor example, in the following scenario:\nThe plains biome provides sky_color = #ff0000 (red) The desert biome provides sky_color = #ffff00 (yellow) sky_color is one such attribute that will transition smoothly based on position: for example, in the above scenario, as a player moves from a plains to a desert biome, the sky color will gradually shift from red to yellow. Other attributes, such as water_evaporates, represent discrete values and will not be smoothly transitioned - only the biome exactly at a subject position will be considered.\nSmooth transitions between biomes are based on the biomes within an 8 block radius of the camera. Biomes that occupy a larger portion of that radius and are closer to the camera will have a stronger influence on the final interpolated value.\nEnvironment Attribute Map #\rDimension Type and Biome definitions contain a new attributes field, enabling them to define Environment Attributes.\nThis map generally takes the form of an object mapping between Environment Attribute IDs and their corresponding values, for example:\n\u0026#34;attributes\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;minecraft:visual/fog_color\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#ffaa00\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates\u0026#34;: true } Values defined as above will always be assumed to use the override modifier.\nThe value object can however be expanded in order to express different modifiers, in the format of an object with the following fields:\nmodifier: optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below) Default: override argument: the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier) How the argument is used also depends on the type of modifier For example, the following definition describes multiplying water_fog_radius by 85%:\n\u0026#34;attributes\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;minecraft:visual/water_fog_radius\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;modifier\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;multiply\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;argument\u0026#34;: 0.85 } } Common Data Types #\rThe following data types are reused in various parts of the Environment Attributes system and will be referenced in sections below.\nRGB Color #\rFormat can be one of the following:\nA hex color RGB string, in the form #rrggbb A float array with 3 components, between 0 and 1, in the form [r, g, b] An integer in packed RGB form ARGB Color #\rFormat can be one of the following:\nA hex color ARGB string, in the form #aarrggbb A float array with 4 components, between 0 and 1, in the form [a, r, g, b] An integer in packed ARGB form Particle Options #\rA full definition of a particle, including any type-specific properties (as in the /particle command).\nFor example:\n{ \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;minecraft:block_crumble\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;block_state\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;minecraft:dirt\u0026#34; } } Common Modifiers #\rEvery Environment Attribute has a specific value type, which describes how values must be defined as well as what modifiers are available and how they are interpolated. Some are very specific, while others are reused across many attributes.\nAlthough this is not an exhaustive list, the following Attribute Types are used commonly across many Environment Attributes:\nModifiers on Boolean Values #\rArgument format: boolean\noverride and nand or nor xor xnor Modifiers on Float Values #\rArgument format: float\noverride add subtract multiply minimum maximum Modifiers on Color Values #\rArgument format: RGB color (except alpha_blend)\noverride add - component-wise additive color blending subtract - component-wise subtractive color blending multiply - component-wise multiplicative color blending alpha_blend - traditional alpha blending that might be seen in image editing software Argument format: ARGB Color When the argument alpha is 1, it will behave as an override with no blending New Environment Attributes #\rminecraft:visual/fog_color #\rThe color of fog (when the camera is not submerged in another substance).

ws://\u0026lt;management-server-host\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;management-server-port\u0026gt; when enabled Supports querying and updating of server state (players, allowlist, operators, settings, game rules) Sends notifications on state changes (e.g. player joins, game rule updates) Calling {\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:1,\u0026quot;method\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;rpc.discover\u0026quot;} returns an API schema containing supported methods and notifications of the currently running server The Data Generator produces an API schema (json-rpc-api-schema.json) in the reports output folder mirroring the contents returned by the rpc.discover method The API adheres to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification Uses namespaced methods and the reserved namespaces are minecraft (e.g. minecraft:players, minecraft:allowlist/add) Extensible via custom namespaces for additional methods and events Core method groups: players, allowlist, operators, server (save, stop), server settings, game rules Example

Drafts, even if the player intentionally closed their chat Server Code of Conduct #\rWhen connecting to a server, a Code of Conduct screen can now be shown.\nAccepting the Code of Conduct is required to play on the server A checkbox is available for not showing the same Code of Conduct in the future If the Code of Conduct changes, it will be shown again Server Setup #\rA new boolean field has been added to server.properties called enable-code-of-conduct Setting it to true will make the server look for Code of Conduct files in the codeofconduct subfolder in the same folder as server.properties Each file in the folder should have the form \u0026lt;language_code\u0026gt;.txt and be UTF-8 encoded The language shown will attempt to match the player\u0026rsquo;s language If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, the en_us Code of Conduct will be used If that also doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, an arbitrary available entry is used Sounds #\rSome sound sliders in the Music \u0026amp; Sound Options now play a preview sound when adjusting the setting outside a world Accessibility #\rThe \u0026ldquo;Attack/Destroy\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Use Item/Place Block\u0026rdquo; key binds are now toggleable, meaning they can be set to either \u0026ldquo;Hold\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Toggle\u0026rdquo; in the Controls screen Added \u0026ldquo;Invert Mouse X\u0026rdquo; option to the Mouse Settings screen, which inverts the mouse x-axis Added \u0026ldquo;Sprint Window\u0026rdquo; option to the Controls screen, which represents the time window in ticks where double-tapping the forward key activates sprint Multiple key binds that have the same key assigned to them can now work together, while before only one would work For example, you can now bind D to Jump and Strafe Left to jump and strafe left at the same time The red warning for assigning the same key to multiple key binds is changed to yellow The spectator hotbar menu key can now be rebound It is part of a new Spectator category in the Key Binds screen, alongside the pre-existing Highlight Players key bind Changes #\rPerformance improvements The Chain block has been renamed to \u0026ldquo;Iron Chain\u0026rdquo; Monster Spawn Eggs now have a tooltip warning when the difficulty is set to Peaceful The mob no longer spawns for one tick when an attempt is made to use the Spawn Egg Changes to world loading and the \u0026ldquo;Spawn Chunks\u0026rdquo; A dimension that has any player activity, forceloaded chunks, active portals, or Ender Pearls in flight will be considered \u0026ldquo;active\u0026rdquo; and will keep processing chunks and entities Previously, this would only apply if a player was in the dimension or a chunk was forceloaded Reworked the debug overlay to be less cluttered and more configurable Players seen in the game world of the current server are now always shown in the Social Interactions screen even if they are offline Players now stop flying when switching from Spectator Mode to Creative Mode if they are near the ground A player is considered to be near the ground if there is a collidable surface (i.e. blocks, Happy Ghasts, boats\u0026hellip;) within 1 block below them Flight will not get disabled if the player was inside a block or collidable entity This is to prevent players from suddenly falling through the ground Migrated several server properties into game rules OpenGL 3.3 is now required to play the game, up from 3.2. This does not change our posted Minimum Requirements Developer's Note: We do not expect the update to OpenGL version to affect many people, if any at all. Our posted Minimum Requirement has been OpenGL 4.0 since 2017, and OpenGL 3.3 turned 15 years old recently.\rPerformance Improvements #\rEntity rendering order was improved for significantly better performance You’ll notice much smoother gameplay in areas with lots of mobs, like mob farms FPS won’t improve much if most of your lag comes from things other than entities, like playing with high render distance while not being near many mobs Particles outside the player\u0026rsquo;s view are not rendered anymore, which provides a performance improvement in some cases World Loading and Spawn Chunks #\rThe concept of fixed \u0026ldquo;Spawn Chunks\u0026rdquo; has been removed The game will ensure that the following chunks are fully loaded before the player joins or the server starts, in the same way as spawn chunks formerly were: Chunks loaded by the forceload command Chunks active due to portal activity Thrown Ender Pearls (Singleplayer only) A small area of chunks around the player (Singleplayer only) Chunks required to assign the global world spawn (World creation only) The world loading screen now shows the chunks that the player is about to be placed into, rather than chunks loaded around world spawn The loading screen now has a progress bar This progress bar accounts for all kinds of chunk loading mentioned above Developer's Note: Spawn chunks incur a memory and performance cost for all players and have outlived their initial technical purpose of keeping the spawn area ready for players to quickly join into.\rHowever, we also want to recognize that spawn chunks have enabled a multitude of clever contraptions and farms throughout the years, so simply removing them without having other mechanics in the game enable these designs was never an option.\nWe believe that the niche held by spawn chunks has now been filled by alternative methods of chunk loading, such as using portals or ender pearls, particularly with the changes in this snapshot to how the game loads these chunks before the world starts ticking.\nServer Properties #\rSeveral server properties were removed in favor of making them into game rules, allowing these settings to be changed while the server is running.\nRemoved server property allow-nether in favor of the new game rule allowEnteringNetherUsingPortals Removed server property spawn-monsters in favor of the new game rule spawnMonsters Removed server property enable-command-block in favor of the new game rule commandBlocksEnabled Removed server property pvp in favor of the new game rule pvp Added server property management-server-enabled controlling whether the new Minecraft Server Management Protocol is enabled or not Defaults to false Added server property management-server-port controlling on what port the Minecraft Server Management Protocol is started Defaults to 0, assigning an available port each time management server is started Added server property management-server-host controlling with what host the new Minecraft Server Management Protocol is started Defaults to localhost Added server property management-server-tls-enabled controlling whether the Minecraft Server Management Protocol uses TLS or not Defaults to true Added server property management-server-tls-keystore controlling the path to the keystore file used for TLS Defaults to an empty string A dedicated server won\u0026rsquo;t start when TLS is enabled and no keystore is provided Added server property management-server-tls-keystore-password controlling the password to the keystore file used for TLS Defaults to an empty string Added server property status-heartbeat-interval controlling the interval the management server sends heartbeat notifications to connected clients Defaults to 0, meaning it’s disabled Added server property enable-code-of-conduct Details on this property can be found in the \u0026ldquo;Server Setup\u0026rdquo;

such as: Worn armor Worn Elytra The outside layers on player skins The ribcages of Skeletons or Skeleton Horses The feet of Chickens or Frogs The wings of Phantoms or the Ender Dragon The fins on fish And more! Recipes #\rChanged the Copper Trapdoor recipe to use 4 Copper Ingots instead of 6 and now yields one Copper Trapdoor instead of two Sounds #\rThe Happy Ghast is now audible from 64 blocks Sounds for Chests now play at a lower volume The volume at which a sound is played at now respects the sound source volume value The \u0026ldquo;Voice/Speech\u0026rdquo; sound source has been rephrased to \u0026ldquo;Narrator/Voice\u0026rdquo; UI #\rThe Resource Pack and Data Pack selection screens now have a search box More text inputs now support selecting text by mouse dragging Double-clicking a word in an edit box now selects it When adding a new server to the server list, the server name is no longer prefilled When omitted, the default name \u0026ldquo;Minecraft Server\u0026rdquo; is used Mouse cursor #\rSome UI components will now change the shape of the mouse cursor Examples: text inputs, numeric sliders, buttons, scroll bars Additionally, clickable parts of text labels (like links) will now change the cursor to the \u0026ldquo;hand\u0026rdquo; shape This feature can be disabled with the \u0026ldquo;Allow Cursor Changes\u0026rdquo; option in the Mouse Settings screen Debug Overlay #\rThe debug overlay is accessible by pressing F3, as before The debug overlay can now be accessed from everywhere in the game, not only when in a game world It is now less cluttered, displaying less information by default Added a new Debug Options screen, available by pressing F3 + F6, which can be used to configure what debug information should be displayed For each element, you can configure whether it should be visible in the debug overlay or not, and can even set it to always be visible regardless of the debug overlay being active Some debug features that were previously available, like chunk border rendering or entity hitbox rendering, can now be toggled through this Debug Options screen Some debug features that were not previously available to the community, like Octree visualization, are now accessible through the Debug Options screen The state of the Debug Options screen is saved between launches of the game The Debug Options screen has the following preset profiles: Default resets everything to the default state Performance shows simple performance metrics, including the FPS meter always visible Developer's Note: Previously, gathering the information every frame to render the F3 screen had a significant performance cost. So opening the screen to check your FPS noticeably dropped the FPS. Now checking your FPS in the`Performance` profile should not affect game performance.\rChat #\rIt is now possible to start chatting while standing inside a Nether Portal The chat will now remain open and unchanged if the player was chatting before being transferred to another dimension Accessibility #\rDye Colors now have updated icons The goal with these is to enhance visual cohesion across the dye set while maintaining distinct shapes to support colorblind accessibility New Old A button leading to the Controls screen has been added to the Accessibility Settings screen The \u0026ldquo;Auto-Jump\u0026rdquo; option, as well as the \u0026ldquo;Sneak\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Sprint\u0026rdquo; toggles have been removed from the Accessibility Settings screen The \u0026ldquo;Show Subtitles\u0026rdquo; option has been rephrased to \u0026ldquo;Closed Captions\u0026rdquo; to more accurately describe what it does The \u0026ldquo;Hide Lightning Flashes\u0026rdquo; accessibility setting has been renamed to \u0026ldquo;Hide Sky Flashes\u0026rdquo; as it includes the End light flashes Technical Changes #\rPack versions now have minor versions The Data Pack version is now 88.0 The Resource Pack version is now 69.0 Some previously hidden debug features have been exposed to players Pack Formats #\rThe pack versions for data packs and resource packs now have minor versions A minor version increment of the game\u0026rsquo;s pack version is backwards-compatible, meaning all packs made for previous iterations of the same major version will keep working Packs can set compatibility requirements on minor versions in case they rely on resources introduced in a minor version Pack Metadata #\rThe pack.mcmeta format has been updated:\nThe supported_formats field has been removed If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed The pack_format field is now optional If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required Added required field min_format - specifies the minimum version supported A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g. [74, 1] Specifying a single integer is interpreted as that major version, e.g. 74 is the same thing as [74, 0] Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone Added required field max_format - specifies the maximum version supported A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g. [74, 1] Specifying a single integer is interpreted as any minor version, i.e. the minor version is 0x7fffffff Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone For overlay entries: The formats field has been removed If your pack includes any overlay range that includes a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required for all overlay definitions Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed Added required fields min_format and max_format with the same formats as the fields above with the same name for the pack section Example:\n{ \u0026#34;pack\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;new pack.mcmeta example\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;min_format\u0026#34;: 69, \u0026#34;max_format\u0026#34;: 99 } } Debug Features #\rSome debug features that were previously removed during compilation are now preserved and can be used by players Individual values can be enabled with JVM properties: First, a global debug flag must be enabled with -DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED or -DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED=true Then, a specific feature can be enabled, for example -DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN or -DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN=true To get the list of all available debug properties, add -DMC_DEBUG_PRINT_PROPERTIES Warning: this is debug code, and the primary intention is to help modders - not for normal play.

Optional namespaced ID of the skin texture to use for rendering The skin is specified relative to the textures folder and with a .png suffix e.g. entity/player/wide/steve will use the default wide Steve skin cape - Optional namespaced ID of the cape texture to use for rendering When specified, uses the same format as the texture field elytra - Optional namespaced ID of the elytra texture to use for rendering When specified, uses the same format as the texture field If this value is not present either as an override or in a player profile, Mannequins using this profile will use the cape texture, or if that is also not present, the default Elytra texture when wearing an Elytra model -

These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve.

when placed next to each other, up to 3 powered Shelves will connect\nInteracting with a single powered Shelf swaps all its contents with the 3 rightmost items in the player\u0026rsquo;s hotbar Interacting with two connected Shelves swaps their contents with the 6 rightmost items in the player\u0026rsquo;s hotbar Interacting with three connected Shelves swaps their contents with all items in the player\u0026rsquo;s hotbar It does not matter which of the connected Shelves the player interacts with Accessibility #\rThe \u0026ldquo;Attack/Destroy\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Use Item/Place Block\u0026rdquo; keybinds are now toggleable, meaning they can be set to either \u0026ldquo;Hold\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Toggle\u0026rdquo; in the Controls screen Added \u0026ldquo;Invert Mouse X\u0026rdquo; option to the Mouse Settings screen, which inverts the mouse x-axis Added \u0026ldquo;Sprint Window\u0026rdquo; option to the Controls screen, which represents the time window in ticks where double-tapping the forward key activates sprint Changes #\rMonster Spawn Eggs now have a tooltip warning when the difficulty is set to Peaceful The mob no longer spawns for one tick when an attempt is made to use the Spawn Egg The debug screen was reworked to be less cluttered and more configurable Changes to world loading and the \u0026ldquo;Spawn Chunks\u0026rdquo; A dimension that has any player activity, forceloaded chunks, active portals, or Ender Pearls in flight will be considered \u0026ldquo;active\u0026rdquo; and will keep processing chunks and entities Previously, this would only apply if a player was in the dimension or a chunk was forceloaded World Loading and Spawn Chunks #\rThe concept of fixed \u0026ldquo;Spawn Chunks\u0026rdquo; has been removed The game will ensure that the following chunks are fully loaded before the player joins or the server starts, in the same way as spawn chunks formerly were: Chunks loaded by the forceload command Chunks active due to portal activity Ender Pearls thrown in Singleplayer (Singleplayer only) The small area of chunks around the player (Singleplayer only) Chunks required to assign the global world spawn (World creation only) The world loading screen now shows the chunks that the player is about to be placed into, rather than chunks loaded around world spawn The loading screen additionally now includes a progress bar This progress bar accounts for all kinds of chunk loading as mentioned above Developer's Note: Developer’s Note: Spawn chunks incur a memory and performance cost for all players and have outlived their initial technical purpose of keeping the spawn area ready for players to quickly join into.\rHowever, we also want to recognise that spawn chunks have enabled a multitude of clever contraptions and farms throughout the years, so simply removing them without having other mechanics in the game enable these designs was never an option.\rWe believe that the niche held by spawn chunks has now been filled by alternative methods of chunk loading, such as using portals or ender pearls, particularly with the changes in this snapshot to how the game loads these chunks before the world starts ticking.\rSounds #\rHappy ghast is now audible from 64 blocks Sounds for chests now plays at a lower volume The volume at which a sound is played at now respects the sound source volume value The \u0026ldquo;Voice/Speech\u0026rdquo; sound source has been rephrased to \u0026ldquo;Narrator/Voice\u0026rdquo; UI #\rDebug Screen #\rThe debug screen is accessible by pressing F3, as before It can now be accessed from everywhere in the game, not only when in a game world It now displays less information by default Added a new Debug Options screen which can be opened by pressing F3 + F5 It can be used to configure which debug information should be displayed For each item you can choose if it should be turned off, visible when the debug screen (F3) is open, or it should always be visible, even when the debug screen is closed Some debug features that were previously available, like chunk border rendering or entity hitbox rendering, can now be toggled through this debug options screen Some debug features that were not previously available to the community, like Octree visualization, are now accessible through the debug options screen The state of the debug options screen is saved between the launches of the game The debug options screen has the following preset profiles: Default resets everything to the default state Performance shows simple performance metrics, including the FPS meter always visible on screen Developer's Note: Previously the information gathering every frame to render the F3 screen had a significant performance cost. So opening the screen to check you FPS noticably dropped the FPS. Now checking your FPS in `Performance` profile should not affect game performance.\rAccessibility #\rA button leading to the Controls screen has been added to the Accessibility Settings screen\nThe \u0026ldquo;Auto-Jump\u0026rdquo; option, as well as the \u0026ldquo;Sneak\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Sprint\u0026rdquo; toggles have been removed from the Accessibility Settings screen The \u0026ldquo;Show Subtitles\u0026rdquo; option has been rephrased to \u0026ldquo;Closed Captions\u0026rdquo; to more accurately describe what it does\nDye Colors now have updated icons\nThe goal with these is to enhance visual cohesion across the dye set while maintaining distinct shapes to support colorblind accessibility Performance Improvements #\rEntity rendering order was improved for significantly better performance You’ll notice much smoother gameplay in areas with lots of mobs, like mob farms FPS won’t improve much if most of your lag comes from things other than entities, like playing with high render distance while not being near many mobs Developer's Note: This change is quite big, and we would not be surprised if we introduced some ordering issues with this. For example, some part of some mob rendering too early or too late and is not visible or is visually broken. Please play around with this and report the bugs you encounter!\rTechnical Changes #\rPack versions now have minor versions The Data Pack version is now 82.0 The Resource Pack version is now 65.0 Pack Formats #\rThe pack versions for data packs and resource packs now have minor versions A minor version increment of the game\u0026rsquo;s pack version is backwards-compatible, meaning all packs made for previous iterations of the same major version will keep working Packs can set compatibility requirements on minor versions in case they rely on resources introduced in a minor version Pack Metadata #\rThe pack.mcmeta format has been updated:\nThe supported_formats field has been removed If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed The pack_format field is now optional If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required Added required field min_format - specifies the minimum version supported A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g [74, 1] Specifying a single integer is interpreted as that major version, e.g. 74 is the same thing as [74, 0] Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone Added required field max_format - specified the maximum version supported A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g [74, 1] Specifying a single integer is interpreted as any minor version, i.e. the minor version is 0x7fffffff Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone For overlay entries: The formats field has been removed If your pack includes any overlay range that includes a pack version with the previous format (data pack \u0026lt; 82, resource pack \u0026lt; 65), it is still required for all overlay definitions Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed Added required field min_format and max_format with the same formats the fields above with the same name for the pack section Example:\n{ \u0026#34;pack\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;new pack.mcmeta example\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;min_format\u0026#34;: 69, \u0026#34;max_format\u0026#34;: 99 } } Data Pack Version 82.0 #\rCommands #\rThe summon command now fails when trying to summon monsters while the difficulty is set to Peaceful Game Rules #\rRemoved spawnChunkRadius game rule Data Components #\rblocks_attacks Item Component #\rIf the damage reduced in an attack is 0, for example by angle threshold not matching, the item can no longer get disabled in the attack, nor cause knockback due to blocking Loot Tables #\rAdded minecraft:entity_interact loot table type which takes the following parameters: target_entity, the entity being interacted with interacting_entity, the optional entity that is interacting with the target_entity tool, the tool used to interact with target_entity Added minecraft:block_interact loot table type which takes the following parameters: block_state, the block state of the block entity being interacted with block_entity, the optional block entity being interacted with interacting_entity, the optional entity that is interacting with the block_state tool, the optional tool used to interact with block_state Fields that specify a target entity in a loot table, such as entity_properties.entity, can additionally target the target_entity and interacting_entity parameter types Added charged_creeper/root loot table for drops when an entity is killed by a Charged Creeper This loot table dispatches on the mob that was killed, to the following loot tables: charged_creeper/piglin charged_creeper/creeper charged_creeper/skeleton charged_creeper/wither_skeleton charged_creeper/zombie Once any mob killed drops an item from this loot table, other mobs killed by the same Creeper will not drop from this loot table Added brush/armadillo loot table for drops when an Armadillo is brushed Added gameplay/turtle_grow loot table for drops when a Turtle grows into an adult Added harvest/beehive loot table for drops when a Beehive or Bee Nest is harvested using Shears Added harvest/cave_vine loot table for drops when a Cave Vine with Glowberries is harvested by interacting with it Added carve/pumpkin loot table for drops when a Pumpkin is carved using Shears World Generation #\rThe initial_density_without_jaggedness field in noise_settings definitions has been replaced with a preliminary_surface_level field initial_density_without_jaggedness was a 3D density function that was used to determine an approximate surface level by scanning for the first point with a density greater than 0.390625 preliminary_surface_level is a 2D density function that should produce the y-level of the approximate surface The minecraft:find_top_surface density function can be used to replicate the previous scanning Density Functions #\rAdded minecraft:find_top_surface #\rApproximates the topmost surface of a given density function It scans from an upper bound to a lower bound to find the point at which the density changes from negative to positive The upper bound should be as close to the actual surface for best performance The upper bound should never be lower than the actual surface Fields:\ndensity - density function to approximate the surface of upper_bound - 2D density function providing the highest possible y-value lower_bound - integer, lowest possible y-value cell_height - positive integer defining the grid resolution on which to scan Added minecraft:invert #\rResolves to 1/argument Fields:\nargument - density function Jigsaw Structures #\rThe max_distance_from_center field may now specify a different restriction on the vertical axis from horizontal This can be specified by an object with fields: horizontal - required integer between 1 and 128 vertical - optional integer between 1 and 4096 (default: 4096) e.g: \u0026quot;max_distance_from_center\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;horizontal\u0026quot;: 20, \u0026quot;vertical\u0026quot;: 500 } The previous format of a single inline value specifying both horizontal and vertical distance is still supported Tags #\rBlock Tags #\rAdded #copper_chests -

These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve.

Our posted Minimum Requirements has been OpenGL 4.0 since 2017, and OpenGL 3.3 turned 15 years old recently.\rMinor Tweaks to Blocks, Items and Entities\nFixed a bug where breaking a Shelf while another player is interacting with it could lead to visual bugs in the player inventory\nCopper Golems hitbox has been tweakedThe hitbox is now 0.49 blocks in width to be able to pathfind through narrow spaces\nCopper Golems can now open doors\nTest Instance Blocks now preserve error markers between world reloads\nAmbient lighting on entities has been adjusted to be more visually in line with blocks and other parts of the gameThe underside of flat surfaces will now be lit from that direction, instead of the opposite direction This mainly affects models containing cubes that are either flat or \u0026ldquo;hollow\u0026rdquo; such as:\nWorn armor Worn Elytra The outside layers on player skins The ribcages of Skeletons or Skeleton Horses The feet of Chickens or Frogs The wings of Phantoms or the Ender Dragon The fins on fish And more! Game Mode Switching #\rSwitching from Spectator Mode to Creative Mode no longer causes the player to stop flying Instead, flight now only gets disabled when switching game modes if the player is near the ground A player is considered to be near the ground if there is a collidable surface (i.e. blocks, Happy Ghasts, boats\u0026hellip;) within 1 block below them Flight will not get disabled if the player was inside a block or collidable entity This is to prevent players from suddenly falling through the ground Developer's Note: This change is a partial revert of a bugfix from a previous snapshot. Even though the old behavior prior to the fix was unintended, the approach we took to fixing flight didn't quite land the way we wanted it to. In response to community feedback, we're trying this new approach as a less disruptive alternative.\rMinecraft Server Management Protocol #\rClients must authenticate to access the API\nClients should supply an Authorization bearer token header with a server specific secret The secret is configured in the server properties file management-server-secret= The secret should be exactly 40 alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) The secret will be automatically generated if the server property is empty Unauthorized requests are rejected with 401 Unauthorized TLS is enabled by default\nCan be disabled in the server properties file\nmanagement-server-tls-enabled=false Requires a keystore file to be set in the server properties file\nmanagement-server-tls-keystore=path/to/keystore.p12 The keystore file must be in PKCS12 format\nKeystore password can be set in the following ways, in order of priority\nEnvironment variable: MINECRAFT_MANAGEMENT_TLS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD JVM argument: -Dmanagement.tls.keystore.password= Server property: management-server-tls-keystore-password= Server Properties #\rDefault value of management-server-port was changed from 25585 to 0, assigning an available port each time management server is started Added server property management-server-tls-enabled controlling whether the Minecraft Server Management Protocol uses TLS or not Defaults to true Added server property management-server-tls-keystore controlling the path to the keystore file used for TLS Defaults to an empty string A dedicated server won\u0026rsquo;t start when TLS is enabled and no keystore is provided Added server property management-server-tls-keystore-password controlling the password to the keystore file used for TLS Defaults to an empty string Game Rules #\rAdded spawnerBlocksEnabled game rule controlling if Spawner Blocks should be enabled or not Defaults to true Mob Spawning #\rLogic for choosing type of equipment for mobs spawning with equipment has been tweaked to add Copper as a possibility The initial roll to choose a type now chooses between Leather, Copper and Gold The chance to increase an armor tier has increased from 9.5% to 10.87% Sounds #\rSome sound sliders in the Music \u0026amp; Sound Options now play a preview sound when adjusting the setting outside a world UI #\rThe Resource Pack and Data Pack selection screens now have a search box Technical Changes #\rThe Data Pack version is now 87.0\nThe Resource Pack version is now 69.0\nSome previously hidden debug features have been exposed to players\nDebug features #\rSome debug features that were previously removed during compilation are now preserved and can be used by players Individual values can be enabled with JVM properties: First, a global debug flag must be enabled with -DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED or -DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED=true Then, a specific feature can be enabled, for example -DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN or -DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN=true To get the list of all available debug properties, add -DMC_DEBUG_PRINT_PROPERTIES Warning: this is debug code.

has been added to allow accessing content-configured dialogs Quick Actions Keybind #\rA new keybind has been addded that allows users to access a set of dialogs Default key: G This feature is configured by minecraft:quick_actions dialog tag If this tag is empty, the keybind does nothing If this tag has a single element, the keybind will open this dialog If this tag has multiple elements, the keybind will lead to minecraft:quick_actions dialog which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements If this dialog is removed, the keybind does nothing This option is intended to be used in custom content and by servers, so this tag is empty by default Common Dialog fields #\rNew fields:\npause - if the dialog screen should pause the game in single-player mode, default: true after_action - an additional operation performed on the dialog after click or submit actions, default: close close - closes the dialog and returns to the previous non-dialog screen (if any) none - does nothing, i.e. keeps the current dialog screen open only available if pause is false to avoid locking the game in single-player mode wait_for_response - replace the current dialog with a \u0026ldquo;Waiting for Response\u0026rdquo; screen this option is intended to prevent users from sending multiple actions on slow connections servers are expected to eventually replace this screen with a new dialog to avoid accidental locking, a \u0026ldquo;Back\u0026rdquo; button will become active after 5 seconds clicking this button will continue as if the dialog was closed (i.e. the game returns to the previous non-dialog screen, if any) The \u0026ldquo;Waiting for Response\u0026rdquo; screen will unpause the game in single-player mode to avoid locking the game Dialog Types #\rChanged minecraft:multi_action, minecraft:server_links, minecraft:dialog_list #\rReplaced field on_cancel with exit_action, holding an optional action If exit_action is present, a button for it will appear in footer, otherwise the footer is not present exit_action is also used for the Escape action Removed minecraft:simple_input_form #\rSince any dialog can now have inputs, this dialog can be replaced by minecraft:notice Removed minecraft:multi_action_input_form #\rSince any dialog can now have inputs, this dialog can be replaced by minecraft:multi_action (without any specified exit_action) Input Control Types #\rTo accomodate the new minecraft:custom click event, all inputs will now return either a string or an NBT tag, depending on context minecraft:text #\rOutput values: As template substitution: contents without modification As tag: a string tag with contents without modification minecraft:boolean #\rOutput values: As template substitution: on_true when checked, on_false when unchecked As tag: 1b when checked, 0b when unchecked minecraft:number_range #\rOutput values: As template substitution: text representation of current value Whole numbers will be sent without decimal point As tag: a float tag with current value Dialog Body Types #\rHover and click events on text components within bodies now work as expected\nClick events are handled by the dialog screen like any other action - that means it will also run the after_action Actions #\rThe format of actions has been changed due to the merging of plain and input dialogs After every action the dialog will always evaluate the contents of the after_action field (see above) Fields:\nKept fields: label, tooltip, width New field: action (replaces on_click and on_submit) - an action to perform when button is clicked, optional object with fields: type - value from minecraft:dialog_action_type registry type-specific\u0026lt; - see below, depends on type\nStatic Dialog Action Types #\rAll existing click_event actions (except for open_file) are included as dialog action types.\nUses same format as click_event on text components (but with action replaced with type) For example, when using show_dialog, entry for action button will look like:\n{\r\u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some label\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;action\u0026#34;: {\r\u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;show_dialog\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;dialog\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some:id\u0026#34;\r}\r} minecraft:dynamic/run_command Action Type #\rThis action will build a run_command event using a provided macro template The macro will be expanded with string values from all inputs For example, if the macro template is some_command $(some_input), the string value from the input with key of some_input will be used for the template expansion Inputs not used in macro will be ignored, while macro parameters not matching any inputs will be replaced with an empty string Fields:\ntemplate - a string with a macro template to be interpreted as a command minecraft:dynamic/custom Action Type #\rThis method will build a minecraft:custom event using all input values All input contents will be sent together inside a compound tag, with tag value of each input put under id from key field of that input Additional static fields can be added to payload Fields:\nadditions - fields to be added to payload, optional compound tag id - namespaced ID Resource Pack version 63 #\rAdded oversized_in_gui item model field Introduced new player head special model type Item Models #\rItem model definitions now have a boolean field oversized_in_gui which is false by default If true, the item model will be allowed to be bigger than its item slot If false, the item model will be clipped to the item slot size when being rendered in gui This ability of items being rendered outside their slots should not be considered officially supported, it was temporarily restored as an exception since many servers are relying on it At some point in the future we hope to replace it with an officially supported way of achieving similar functionality Introduced new item model minecraft:player_head to handle player profile texture loading and rendering Removed support for minecraft:profile from minecraft:head minecraft:player_head special model type #\rRenders a player head Uses profile from the minecraft:profile component to load a texture.

dialogs to be accessible from Pause screen This feature replaces \u0026ldquo;Server Links\u0026rdquo; button and is placed on Pause screen according to the same rules Buttons leading to dialogs exposed in this way will use label described in external_title field This feature is configured by minecraft:pause_screen_additions dialog tag: If this tag is not specified or is empty but the server has sent server_links packet, tag will be handled as if it contained minecraft:server_links dialog Note: this matches previous Server Links feature behavior If this dialog is removed, the tag remains empty If this tag is still empty, button is not visible (\u0026ldquo;Send Feedback\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Report Bugs\u0026rdquo; buttons are visible instead) If this tag has a single element, Pause screen button will lead directly to this dialog If this tag has multiple elements, Pause screen button will lead to minecraft:custom_options which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements If this dialog is removed, button is not visible Text Components #\rClick Events #\rNew click action minecraft:custom has been added When user clicks a component with this click action,
